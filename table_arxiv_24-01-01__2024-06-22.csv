Parameterized quasinormal frequencies and Hawking radiation for axial gravitational perturbations of a holonomy-corrected black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15711v1,"Sen Yang, Wen-Di Guo, Qin Tan, Li Zhao, Yu-Xiao Liu","As the fingerprints of black holes, quasinormal modes are closely associated with many properties of black holes. Especially, the ringdown phase of gravitational waveforms from the merger of compact binary components can be described by quasinormal modes. Serving as a model-independent approach, the framework of parameterized quasinormal frequencies offers a universal method for investigating quasinormal modes of diverse black holes. In this work, we first obtain the Schrödinger-like master equation of the axial gravitational perturbation of a holonomy-corrected black hole. We calculate the corresponding quasinormal frequencies using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation and asymptotic iteration methods. We investigate the numerical evolution of an initial wave packet on the background spacetime. Then, we deduce the parameterized expression of the quasinormal frequencies and find that $r_0 \leq 10^{-2}$ is a necessary condition for the parameterized approximation to be valid. We also study the impact of the quantum parameter $r_0$ on the greybody factor and Hawking radiation. With more ringdown signals of gravitational waves detected in the future, our research will contribute to the study of the quantum properties of black holes.","{'black holes': 4, 'hawking radiation': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Observation of a non-Hermitian supersonic mode,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15557v1,"Yuxuan Zhang, Juan Carrasquilla, Yong Baek Kim","Quantum computers have long been anticipated to excel in simulating quantum many-body physics. While most previous work has focused on Hermitian physics, we demonstrate the power of variational quantum circuits for resource-efficient simulations of dynamical and equilibrium physics in non-Hermitian systems, revealing new phenomena beyond standard Hermitian quantum machines. Using a variational quantum compilation scheme for fermionic systems, we reduce gate count, save qubits, and eliminate the need for postselection, a major challenge in simulating non-Hermitian dynamics via standard Trotterization. Experimentally, we observed a supersonic mode in the connected density-density correlation function on an $ n = 18 $ fermionic chain after a non-Hermitian, locally interacting quench, which would otherwise be forbidden by the Lieb-Robinson bound in a Hermitian system. Additionally, we investigate sequential quantum circuits generated by tensor networks for ground state preparation, here defined as the eigenstate with the lowest real part eigenvalue, using a variance minimization scheme. Through a trapped-ion implementation on the Quantinuum H1 quantum processor, we accurately capture correlation functions and energies across an exceptional point on a dissipative spin chain up to length $ n = 20 $ using only 3 qubits. Motivated by these advancements, we provide an analytical example demonstrating that simulating single-qubit non-Hermitian dynamics for $Θ(\log(n))$ time from certain initial states is exponentially hard on a quantum computer, offering insights into the opportunities and limitations of using quantum computation for simulating non-Hermitian physics.","{'quantum computer': 1, 'tensor networks': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"
Phase space framework enables a variable-scale diffraction model for coherent imaging and display,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15456v1,"Zhi Li, Xuhao Luo, Jing Wang, Xin Yuan, Dongdong Teng, Qiang Song, Huigao Duan","The fast algorithms in Fourier optics have invigorated multifunctional device design and advanced imaging technologies. However, the necessity for fast computations has led to limitations in the widely used conventional Fourier methods, manifesting as fixed size image plane at a certain diffraction distance. These limitations pose challenges in intricate scaling transformations, 3D reconstructions and full-color displays. Currently, there is a lack of effective solutions, often resorting to pre-processing that compromise fidelity. In this paper, leveraging a higher-dimensional phase space method, we present a universal framework allowing for customized diffraction calculation methods. Within this framework, we establish a variable-scale diffraction computation model which allows the adjustment of the size of the image plane and can be operated by fast algorithms. We validate the model's robust variable-scale capabilities and its aberration automatic correction capability for full-color holography, achieving high fidelity. The large-magnification tomography experiment demonstrates that this model provides a superior solution for holographic 3D reconstruction. In addition, this model is applied to achieve full-color metasurface holography with near-zero crosstalk, showcasing its versatile applicability at nanoscale. Our model presents significant prospects for applications in the optics community, such as beam shaping, computer-generated holograms (CGHs), augmented reality (AR), metasurface optical elements (MOEs) and advanced holographic head-up display (HUD) systems.",{'holography': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Holography']
Cosmological test of an ultraviolet origin of Dark Energy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.15390v1,"Hans Christiansen, Bence Takács, Steen H. Hansen","The accelerated expansion of the Universe is impressively well described by a cosmological constant. However, the observed value of the cosmological constant is much smaller than expected based on quantum field theories. Recent efforts to achieve consistency in these theories have proposed a relationship between Dark Energy and the most compact objects, such as black holes (BH). However, experimental tests are very challenging to devise and perform. In this article, we present a testable model with no cosmological constant, in which the accelerated expansion can be driven by black holes. The model couples the expansion of the Universe (the Friedmann equation) with the mass-function of cosmological haloes (using the Press-Schechter formalism). Through the observed link between halo-masses and BH-masses one thus gets a coupling between the expansion rate of the Universe and the BHs. We compare the predictions of this simple BH model with SN1a data and find a poor agreement with observations. Our method is sufficiently general that it allows us to also test a fundamentally different model, also without a cosmological constant, where the accelerated expansion is driven by a new force proportional to the internal velocity dispersion of galaxies. Surprisingly enough this model cannot be excluded using the SN1a data.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Growth of high redshift supermassive black holes from heavy seeds in the BRAHMA cosmological simulations: Implications of overmassive black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14658v1,"Aklant K Bhowmick, Laura Blecha, Paul Torrey, Rachel S Somerville, Luke Zoltan Kelley, Mark Vogelsberger, Rainer Weinberger, Lars Hernquist, Aneesh Sivasankaran","JWST has recently revealed a large population of accreting black holes (BHs) in the early Universe. Even after accounting for possible systematic biases, the high-z $M_*-M_{\rm \rm bh}$ relation derived from these objects by Pacucci et al. (2023 P23 relation) is above the local scaling relation by $>3σ$. To understand the implications of potentially overmassive high-z BH populations, we study the BH growth at $z\sim4-7$ using the $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations with systematic variations of heavy seed models that emulate direct collapse black hole (DCBH) formation. In our least restrictive seed model, we place $\sim10^5~M_{\odot}$ seeds in halos with sufficient dense and metal-poor gas. To model conditions for direct collapse, we impose additional criteria based on a minimum Lyman Werner flux (LW flux $=10~J_{21}$), maximum gas spin, and an environmental richness criterion. The high-z BH growth in our simulations is merger dominated, with a relatively small contribution from gas accretion. For the most restrictive simulation that includes all the above seeding criteria for DCBH formation, the high-z $M_*-M_{\rm bh}$ relation falls significantly below the P23 relation (by factor of $\sim10$ at $z\sim4$). Only by excluding the spin and environment based criteria, and by assuming $\lesssim750~\mathrm{Myr}$ delay times between host galaxy mergers and subsequent BH mergers, are we able to reproduce the P23 relation. Overall, our results suggest that if high-z BHs are indeed systematically overmassive, assembling them would require more efficient heavy seeding channels, higher initial seed masses, additional contributions from lighter seeds to BH mergers, and / or more efficient modes for BH accretion.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
The Unexpected Lack of Asymmetry in the Horizon-Scale Image of Sagittarius A*,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14641v1,"J. Cole Faggert, Feryal Özel, Dimitrios Psaltis","The ring-like images of the two supermassive black holes captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) provide powerful probes of the physics of accretion flows at horizon scales. Specifically, the brightness asymmetry in the images carries information about the angular velocity profile of the inner accretion flow and the inclination of the observer, owing to the Doppler boosts photons experience at their site of emission. In this paper, we develop a method for quantifying the brightness asymmetry of black-hole images in the Fourier domain, which can be measured directly from interferometric data. We apply this method to current EHT data and find that the image of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) has an unusually low degree of asymmetry that is even lower than that inferred for M87. We then use a covariant semi-analytic model to obtain constraints on the inclinations and velocity profiles of the inner accretion flow for Sgr A*. We find that the lack of significant brightness asymmetry forces the observer inclination to uncomfortably small values ($6-10^\circ$), if the plasma velocity follows Keplerian profiles. Alternatively, larger inclination angles can be accommodated if the plasma velocities are significantly sub-Keplerian and the black hole is not spinning rapidly.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Bayesian Optimization Priors for Efficient Variational Quantum Algorithms,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14627v1,"Farshud Sorourifar, Diana Chamaki, Norm M. Tubman, Joel A. Paulson, David E. Bernal Neira","Quantum computers currently rely on a hybrid quantum-classical approach known as Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) to solve problems. Still, there are several challenges with VQAs on the classical computing side: it corresponds to a black-box optimization problem that is generally non-convex, the observations from the quantum hardware are noisy, and the quantum computing time is expensive. The first point is inherent to the problem structure; as a result, it requires the classical part of VQAs to be solved using global optimization strategies. However, there is a trade-off between cost and accuracy; typically, quantum computers return a set of bit strings, where each bitstring is referred to as a shot. The probabilistic nature of quantum computing (QC) necessitates many shots to measure the circuit accurately. Since QC time is charged per shot, reducing the number of shots yields cheaper and less accurate observations. Recently, there has been increasing interest in using basic Bayesian optimization (BO) methods to globally optimize quantum circuit parameters. This work proposes two modifications to the basic BO framework to provide a shot-efficient optimization strategy for VQAs. Specifically, we provide a means to place a prior on the periodicity of the rotation angles and a framework to place a topological prior using few-shot quantum circuit observations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach through an ablation study, showing that using both proposed features statistically outperforms a standard BO implementation within VQAs for computational chemistry simulations.",{'quantum circuit': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Amplitudes and Polarizations of Quadratic Quasi-Normal Modes for a Schwarzschild Black Hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14611v1,"Bruno Bucciotti, Leonardo Juliano, Adrien Kuntz, Enrico Trincherini","General Relativity predicts the existence of quadratic quasi-normal modes at second order in perturbation theory. Building on our recent work, we compute the amplitudes and polarizations of these modes for non-rotating black holes, showing that they are completely determined by the amplitudes and polarizations of linear modes. We obtain the ratio of quadratic to linear amplitudes, which still depends on the initial conditions of the merger through the polarization of linear modes. However, we demonstrate that this dependence is captured by four fundamental numbers, independent of initial conditions, representing four different combinations of linear modes parities. Additionally, we prove two selection rules regarding the vanishing of classes of quadratic modes. Our results are available online as a package which provides the ratio of amplitudes across a broad spectrum of angular momenta.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum Extreme Learning of molecular potential energy surfaces and force fields,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14607v1,"Gabriele Lo Monaco, Marco Bertini, Salvatore Lorenzo, G. Massimo Palma","Quantum machine learning algorithms are expected to play a pivotal role in quantum chemistry simulations in the immediate future. One such key application is the training of a quantum neural network to learn the potential energy surface and force field of molecular systems. We address this task by using the quantum extreme learning machine paradigm. This particular supervised learning routine allows for resource-efficient training, consisting of a simple linear regression performed on a classical computer. We have tested a setup that can be used to study molecules of any dimension and is optimized for immediate use on NISQ devices with a limited number of native gates. We have applied this setup to three case studies: lithium hydride, water, and formamide, carrying out both noiseless simulations and actual implementation on IBM quantum hardware. Compared to other supervised learning routines, the proposed setup requires minimal quantum resources, making it feasible for direct implementation on quantum platforms, while still achieving a high level of predictive accuracy compared to simulations. Our encouraging results pave the way towards the future application to more complex molecules, being the proposed setup scalable.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Tunneling method for Hawking quanta in analogue gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14603v1,"Francesco Del Porro, Stefano Liberati, Marc Schneider","Analogue Hawking radiation from acoustic horizons is now a well-established phenomenon, both theoretically and experimentally. Its persistence, despite the modified dispersion relations characterising analogue models, has been crucial in advancing our understanding of the robustness of this phenomenon against ultraviolet modifications of our spacetime description. However, previous theoretical approaches, such as the Bogoliubov transformation relating asymptotic states, have somewhat lacked a straightforward physical intuition regarding the origin of this robustness and its limits of applicability. To address this, we revisit analogue Hawking radiation using the tunneling method. We present a unified treatment that allows us to consider flows with and without acoustic horizons and with superluminal or subluminal dispersion relations. This approach clarifies the fundamental mechanism behind the resilience of Hawking radiation in these settings and explains the puzzling occurrence of excitations even in subcritical (supercritical) flows with subluminal (superluminal) dispersion relations.",{'hawking radiation': 3},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Ambiguity Clustering: an accurate and efficient decoder for qLDPC codes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14527v1,"Stasiu Wolanski, Ben Barber","Error correction allows a quantum computer to preserve a state long beyond the decoherence time of its physical qubits by encoding logical qubits in a larger number of physical qubits. The leading proposal for a scheme of quantum error correction is based on the surface code, but several recently proposed quantum low-density parity check (qLDPC) codes allow more logical information to be encoded in significantly fewer physical qubits. Key to any scheme of quantum error correction is the decoder, an algorithm that estimates the error state of the qubits from the results of syndrome measurements performed on them. The surface code has a variety of fast and accurate decoders, but the state-of-the-art decoder for general qLDPC codes, BP-OSD, has a high computational complexity. Here we introduce Ambiguity Clustering (AC), an algorithm which seeks to divide the measurement data into clusters which are decoded independently. We benchmark AC on the recently proposed bivariate bicycle codes and find that, at physically realistic error rates, AC is between one and three orders of magnitude faster than BP-OSD with no reduction in logical fidelity. Our CPU implementation of AC is already fast enough to decode the 144-qubit Gross code in real time for neutral atom and trapped ion systems.",{'quantum computer': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In a comparison against a non-variational method based on Trotterized time evolution, we observe a better scaling of the depth requirements using the VQS approach with respect to both the size of the system and the simulated time. Results are also put into perspective by discussing the corresponding classical complexity required for VQS. Our results allow us to identify a possible advantage region for VQS over Trotterization.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Black holes with electroweak hair,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14357v1,"Romain Gervalle, Mikhail S. Volkov","We construct static and axially symmetric magnetically charged hairy black holes in the gravity-coupled Weinberg-Salam theory. Large black holes merge with the Reissner-Nordström (RN) family, while the small ones are extremal and support a hair in the form of a ring-shaped electroweak condensate carrying superconducting W-currents and up to $22\%$ of the total magnetic charge. The extremal solutions are asymptotically RN with a mass {\it below} the total charge, $M<|Q|$, due to the negative Zeeman energy of the condensate interacting with the black hole magnetic field. Therefore, they cannot decay into RN black holes. As their charge increases, they show a phase transition when the horizon symmetry changes from spherical to oblate. At this point they have the mass typical for planetary size black holes of which $\approx 11\%$ are stored in the hair. Being obtained within a well-tested theory, our solutions are expected to be physically relevant.",{'black holes': 4},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Non-stabilizerness in kinetically-constrained Rydberg atom arrays,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14348v1,"Ryan Smith, Zlatko Papić, Andrew Hallam","Non-stabilizer states are a fundamental resource for universal quantum computation. However,despite broad significance in quantum computing, the emergence of ""many-body"" non-stabilizerness in interacting quantum systems remains poorly understood due to its analytical intractability. Here we show that Rydberg atom arrays provide a natural reservoir of non-stabilizerness that extends beyond single qubits and arises from quantum correlations engendered by the Rydberg blockade. We demonstrate that this non-stabilizerness can be experimentally accessed in two complementary ways, either by performing quench dynamics or via adiabatic ground state preparation. Using the analytical framework based on matrix product states, we explain the origin of Rydberg nonstabilizerness via a quantum circuit decomposition of the wave function.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Promise of Graph Sparsification and Decomposition for Noise Reduction in QAOA: Analysis for Trapped-Ion Compilations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14330v1,"Jai Moondra, Philip C. Lotshaw, Greg Mohler, Swati Gupta","We develop new approximate compilation schemes that significantly reduce the expense of compiling the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving the Max-Cut problem. Our main focus is on compilation with trapped-ion simulators using Pauli-$X$ operations and all-to-all Ising Hamiltonian $H_\text{Ising}$ evolution generated by Molmer-Sorensen or optical dipole force interactions, though some of our results also apply to standard gate-based compilations. Our results are based on principles of graph sparsification and decomposition; the former reduces the number of edges in a graph while maintaining its cut structure, while the latter breaks a weighted graph into a small number of unweighted graphs. Though these techniques have been used as heuristics in various hybrid quantum algorithms, there have been no guarantees on their performance, to the best of our knowledge. This work provides the first provable guarantees using sparsification and decomposition to improve quantum noise resilience and reduce quantum circuit complexity.
  For quantum hardware that uses edge-by-edge QAOA compilations, sparsification leads to a direct reduction in circuit complexity. For trapped-ion quantum simulators implementing all-to-all $H_\text{Ising}$ pulses, we show that for a $(1-ε)$ factor loss in the Max-Cut approximation ($ε>0)$, our compilations improve the (worst-case) number of $H_\text{Ising}$ pulses from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n\log(n/ε))$ and the (worst-case) number of Pauli-$X$ bit flips from $O(n^2)$ to $O\left(\frac{n\log(n/ε)}{ε^2}\right)$ for $n$-node graphs. We demonstrate significant reductions in noise are obtained in our new compilation approaches using theory and numerical calculations for trapped-ion hardware.

Post-Newtonian expansions of extreme mass ratio inspirals of spinning bodies into Schwarzschild black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14291v1,"Viktor Skoupý, Vojtěch Witzany","Space-based gravitational-wave detectors such as LISA are expected to detect inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects into massive black holes. Modeling such inspirals requires fully relativistic computations to achieve sufficient accuracy at leading order. However, subleading corrections such as the effects of the spin of the inspiraling compact object may potentially be treated in weak-field expansions such as the post-Newtonian (PN) approach.
  In this work, we calculate the PN expansion of eccentric orbits of spinning bodies around Schwarzschild black holes. Then we use the Teukolsky equation to compute the energy and angular momentum fluxes from these orbits up to the 5PN order. Some of these PN orders are exact in eccentricity, while others are expanded up to the tenth power in eccentricity. Then we use the fluxes to construct a hybrid inspiral model, where the leading part of the fluxes is calculated numerically in the fully relativistic regime, while the part linear in the small spin is analytically approximated using the PN series. We calculate LISA-relevant inspirals and respective waveforms with this model and a fully relativistic model. Through the calculation of mismatch between the waveforms from both models we conclude that the PN approximation of the linear-in-spin part of the fluxes is sufficient for lower eccentricities.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
A Survey of Methods for Mitigating Barren Plateaus for Parameterized Quantum Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14285v1,Michelle Gelman,"Barren Plateaus are a formidable challenge for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that lead to flat plateaus in the loss function landscape making it difficult to take advantage of the expressive power of parameterized quantum circuits with gradient-based methods.

In this review, we present an overview of the different genesis for barren plateaus, mathematical formalisms of common themes around barren plateaus, and dives into gradients. The central objective is to provide a conceptual perspective between classical and quantum interpretations of vanishing gradients as well as dive into techniques involving cost functions, entanglement, and initialization strategies to mitigate barren plateaus.

"Beyond QUBO and HOBO formulations, solving the Travelling Salesman Problem on a quantum boson sampler",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14252v1,"Daniel Goldsmith, Joe Day-Evans","The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is an important combinatorial optimisation problem, and is usually solved on a quantum computer using a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) formulation or a Higher Order Binary Optimisation(HOBO) formulation. In these formulations, penalty terms are added to the objective function for outputs that don't map to valid routes.
  We present a novel formulation which needs fewer binary variables, and where, by design, there are no penalty terms because all outputs from the quantum device are mapped to valid routes. Simulations of a quantum boson sampler were carried out which demonstrate that larger networks can be solved with this penalty-free formulation than with formulations with penalties. Simulations were successfully translated to hardware by running a non-QUBO formulation with penalties on an early experimental prototype ORCA PT-1 boson sampler. Although we worked with a boson sampler, we believe that this novel formulation is relevant to other quantum devices.
  This work shows that a good embedding for combinatorial optimisation problems can solve larger problems with the same quantum computing resource. The flexibility of boson sampling quantum devices is a powerful asset in solving combinatorial optimisation problem, because it enables formulations where the output string is always mapped to a valid solution, avoiding the need for penalties.",{'quantum computer': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14109v1,"Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang","Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a novel non-equilibrium phase transition characterized by entanglement entropy. The scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements. However, common decoherence noises, such as dephasing, are detrimental to the volume law phase, posing a significant challenge for observing MIPT in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise. The conditional entanglement entropy is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as two competing external random fields. Then we show that an average apparatus-environment exchange symmetry ensures the conditional entanglement entropy is a valid probe of entanglement. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on a (2+1)-d quantum circuit under dephasing noise, demonstrating that MIPT can indeed be observed with the aid of quantum-enhanced operations. This result not only serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise but also holds experimental relevance, as the protocol is straightforward to implement in practice.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

However, the system is vulnerable to pure dephasing, which causes unwanted excitations outside the qubit subspace. Therefore, we require a refrigeration technology which confines the system in the qubit subspace. We theoretically study on-chip refrigeration for Kerr-cat qubits based on photon-assisted electron tunneling at tunneling junctions, called quantum circuit refrigerator (QCR). Rates of QCR-induced deexcitations of the system can be changed by more than four orders of magnitude by tuning a bias voltage across the tunneling junctions. Unwanted QCR-induced bit flips are greatly suppressed due to quantum interference in the tunneling process, and thus the long lifetime is preserved.

In addition, we also discuss the effect of the black hole rotation on the Page time and scrambling time.

Inevitable Negativity: Additivity Commands Negative Quantum Channel Entropy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13823v1,"Gilad Gour, Doyeong Kim, Takla Nateeboon, Guy Shemesh, Goni Yoeli","Quantum channels represent a broad spectrum of operations crucial to quantum information theory, encompassing everything from the transmission of quantum information to the manipulation of various resources. In the domain of states, the concept of majorization serves as a fundamental tool for comparing the uncertainty inherent in both classical and quantum systems. This paper establishes a rigorous framework for assessing the uncertainty in both classical and quantum channels. By employing a specific class of superchannels, we introduce and elucidate three distinct approaches to channel majorization: constructive, axiomatic, and operational. Intriguingly, these methodologies converge to a consistent ordering. This convergence not only provides a robust basis for defining entropy functions for channels but also clarifies the interpretation of entropy in this broader context. Most notably, our findings reveal that any viable entropy function for quantum channels must assume negative values, thereby challenging traditional notions of entropy.",{'quantum information theory': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Single-shot quantum machine learning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13812v1,"Erik Recio-Armengol, Jens Eisert, Johannes Jakob Meyer","Quantum machine learning aims to improve learning methods through the use of quantum computers. If it is to ever realize its potential, many obstacles need to be overcome. A particularly pressing one arises at the prediction stage because the outputs of quantum learning models are inherently random. This creates an often considerable overhead, as many executions of a quantum learning model have to be aggregated to obtain an actual prediction. In this work, we analyze when quantum learning models can evade this issue and produce predictions in a near-deterministic way -- paving the way to single-shot quantum machine learning. We give a rigorous definition of single-shotness in quantum classifiers and show that the degree to which a quantum learning model is near-deterministic is constrained by the distinguishability of the embedded quantum states used in the model. Opening the black box of the embedding, we show that if the embedding is realized by quantum circuits, a certain depth is necessary for single-shotness to be even possible. We conclude by showing that quantum learning models cannot be single-shot in a generic way and trainable at the same time.",{'quantum machine learning': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In the real part of the potential, we find out that the dynamical exponent, the hyperscaling violation parameter, and the Yang-Mills charge increase the real potential and decrease the dissociation length, and hence the quarkonium dissociates easily. In the imaginary part of the potential, we show that the dynamical exponent, the hyperscaling violation parameter, and the Yang-Mills charge tend to decrease the thermal width, thus strengthening the suppression of the heavy quarkonium, and making the melting process easier.

Also here, we consider energy flux and equivalence mass-energy principle and examine the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture. The incoming and outgoing energy flux leads to changes in the black hole. In that case, by applying the first law, we examined whether the second law of thermodynamics is valid. And also one can say that, in the case where absorption and superradiance are in the saturated to an equilibrium. Also, by using the thermodynamics of black holes in the restricted phase space, we show that if the black hole is in an extreme or close to an extreme state with radiation and particle absorption, the weak cosmic censorship conjecture is established. In addition, with the help of equivalence mass and energy principle and second-order approximation, in the near extremity, we find that when the black hole radiates and its central charge is greater than the scaled electric charge, the superradiance particles obey the weak gravity conjecture, and this causes the black hole to move further away from its extreme state. But when the particles that obey the weak gravity conjecture are attracted to the black hole when the black hole is very small.

Our black hole solutions are shown to obey the first law and the Bekenstein-Smarr mass formulas of black hole thermodynamics. Moreover, we demonstrate that our static neutral spherically symmetric AdS black hole does not always satisfy the reverse isoperimetric inequality (RII), as the isoperimetric ratio can be larger or smaller than unity depending on the placement of the solution parameters within the parameter space. This behavior contrasts with the above-mentioned Schwarzschild-like AdS black hole in the KR gravity theory, which always obeys the RII.

The other direction is less studied: quantum computing is not often applied to tensor-based problems. Considering tensor decompositions, we focus on discovering practical matrix multiplication algorithms and develop two algorithms to compute decompositions on quantum computers. The algorithms are expressed as higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HUBO) problems, which are translated into quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems. Our first algorithm is decompositional to keep the optimization problem feasible for the current quantum devices. Starting from a suitable initial point, the algorithm discovers tensor decomposition corresponding to the famous Strassen matrix multiplication algorithm, utilizing the current quantum annealers. Since the decompositional algorithm does not guarantee minimal length for found tensor decompositions, we develop a holistic algorithm that can find fixed-length decompositions.

We pay attention to the subtle difference between the notions of wave packets that describe low-energy excitations: QFT wave packet associated with the spatial dimensions of QFT, matrix wave packet associated with the emergent dimensions from matrix degrees of freedom, and bulk wave packet which is a combination of QFT and matrix wave packets. In QFT, there is an intriguing interplay between QFT wave packet and matrix wave packet that connects quantum entanglement and emergent geometry. We propose that the bulk wave packet is the physical object in QFT that describes the emergent geometry from entanglement. This proposal sets a unified view on two seemingly different mechanisms of holographic emergent geometry: one based on matrix eigenvalues and the other based on quantum entanglement. Further intuition comes from the similarity to a traversable wormhole discussed as the dual description of the coupled SYK model by Maldacena and Qi: the bulk can be seen as an eternal traversable wormhole connecting boundary regions.","{'bulk geometry': 1, 'traversable wormhole': 2}",06.2024,2024,06,"['Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"

In this paper, we revisit phenomenological constraints on the neutrino emission from hot-coronae of seyfert galaxies, using an assumption of equi-ripartition between cosmic-rays and magnetic energy densities. We show that not only these sources are consistent with such an assumption but also that the data point towards low beta plasma parameters inside Seyfert Galaxies. We exploit this finding to constrain the Seyfert diffuse neutrino flux and we obtain that, in order not to overproduce neutrinos, not all the sources can be in an equi-ripartition state.

Joint Wire Cutting with Non-Maximally Entangled States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.13315v1,"Marvin Bechtold, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Alexander Mandl, Felix Truger","Distributed quantum computing leverages the collective power of multiple quantum devices to perform computations exceeding the capabilities of individual quantum devices. A currently studied technique to enable this distributed approach is wire cutting, which decomposes a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits by cutting their connecting wires. These subcircuits can then be executed on distributed devices, and their results are classically combined to reconstruct the original computation's result. However, wire cutting requires additional circuit executions to preserve result accuracy, with their number growing exponentially with each cut. Thus, minimizing this sampling overhead is crucial for reducing the total execution time. Employing shared non-maximally entangled (NME) states between distributed devices reduces this overhead for single wire cuts, moving closer to ideal teleportation with maximally entangled states. Extending this approach to jointly cutting multiple wires using NME states remained unexplored. Our paper addresses this gap by investigating the use of NME states for joint wire cuts, aiming to reduce the sampling overhead further. Our three main contributions include (i) determining the minimal sampling overhead for this scenario, (ii) analyzing the overhead when using composite NME states constructed from smaller NME states, and (iii) introducing a wire cutting technique that achieves the optimal sampling overhead with pure NME states, paving the way towards wire cutting with arbitrary NME states.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Our proposed quantum generator leverages variational quantum circuit approach addressing scalability issues by extracting principal components from the images instead of dividing them into patches. Additionally, we integrate the Wasserstein distance within the QIGL framework to generate a diverse set of medical samples.

A possible origin of these supermassive black holes could be through mergers in dense black hole clusters, forming as a result of mass segregation within nuclear star clusters in the center of galaxies. In this study, we present the first systematic investigation of the evolution of such black hole clusters where the effect of an external potential is taken into account. Such a potential could be the result of gas inflows into the central region, for example as a result of galaxy mergers. We show here that the efficiency for the formation of a massive central object is mostly regulated by the ratio of cluster velocity dispersion divided by the speed of light, potentially reaching efficiencies of 0.05-0.08 in realistic systems. Our results show that this scenario is potentially feasible and may provide seeds black hole of at least 10^3 solar masses.

We then employ the Gürses-Gürsey metric and apply the Newman-Janis algorithm to construct a charged rotating interior geometry from the static interior solution. The resulting interior metric and the electromagnetic field are smoothly matched to the exterior Kerr-Newman electrovacuum solution, thus producing a regular interior for the exterior Kerr-Newman geometry.

We also derive a generalization of the Buchdahl bound for charged stars in 4DEGB gravity. As in the uncharged case, we find that quark stars can exist below the general relativistic Buchdahl bound (BB) and Schwarzschild radius $R=2M$, due to the lack of a mass gap between black holes and compact stars in the 4DEGB theory.

Concurrent Accretion and Migration of Giant Planets in their Natal Disks with Consistent Accretion Torque,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.12716v1,"Ya-Ping Li, Yi-Xian Chen, Douglas N. C. Lin","Migration commonly occurs during the epoch of planet formation. For emerging gas giant planets, it proceeds concurrently with their growth through the accretion of gas from their natal protoplanetary disks. Similar migration process should also be applied to the stellar-mass black holes embedded in active galactic nucleus disks. In this work, we perform high resolution 3D and 2D numerical hydrodynamical simulations to study the migration dynamics for accreting embedded objects over the disk viscous timescales in a self-consistent manner. We find that an accreting planet embedded in a predominantly viscous disk has a tendency to migrate outward, in contrast to the inward orbital decay of non-accreting planets. 3D and 2D simulations find the consistent outward migration results for the accreting planets. Under this circumstance, the accreting planet's outward migration is mainly due to the asymmetric spiral arms feeding from the global disk into the Hill radius. This is analogous to the unsaturated corotation torque although the imbalance is due to material accretion within the libration timescale rather than diffusion onto the inner disk. In a disk with a relatively small viscosity, the accreting planets clear deep gaps near their orbits. The tendency of inward migration is recovered, albeit with suppressed rates. By performing a parameter survey with a range of disks' viscosity, we find that the transition from outward to inward migration occurs with the effective viscous efficiency factor $α\sim 0.003$ for Jupiter-mass planets.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

By using the Sklyanin's construction of reflection algebra, we obtain the most general solutions of the boundary Yang-Baxter equation for such a setup. We use this solution to build, from the transfer matrix formalism, integrable circuits with two step discrete time Floquet (aka brickwork) dynamics. We prove that, only if the bulk is a free-model, the boundary matrices are in general non-factorizable, and for particular choice of free parameters yield non-trivial unitary dynamics with boundary interaction between the two chains. Then, we consider the limit of continuous time evolution and we give the interpretation of a restricted set of the boundary terms in the Lindbladian setting.

In particular, we prove the equivalence of the known third order field equations, with the second order ones obtained by us in the conformal Killing parametrization. The structure of the Ricci tensor and of the conformal Killing tensor are compatible with both anisotropic fluid sources and (non)-linear electrodynamics.

Our research delineates a crucial correlation between the dynamics of the accretion disk and the parameters Q and N_{\rm r}, which aptly reflect the influence of spacetime metrics on the disk's appearance. Elevated electric charge Q prompts contraction in the disk's orbit due to enhanced gravitational effects, while higher N_{\rm r} values lead to outward expansion, influenced by the radiation field's attributes. Interestingly, the charged black holes surrounded by radiation fields display distinct visual disparities from RN black holes. Brightness decreases and expansion occurs within the accretion disk's innermost stable circular orbit with rising N_{\rm r} values.

The key to find such a solution is a systematic protocol, which projects out excited states on every cluster using MPS and effectively entangles the cluster states. The protocol offers several advantages, including the ability to achieve exact many-body ground-state solutions at nearly equal cost in one and two dimensions including those with gapless or long-range entangled ground states, flexibility in designing Hamiltonians unbiasedly across various forms of models, and numerically feasible validation through energy calculations.

By performing experiments on IBM quantum devices through cloud access, our results show that despite the potential for error propagation among logical qubits during the transversal CNOT gate operation, increasing the number of physical qubits from 21 to 39 and 57 can suppress errors, which persists over 10 rounds of error detection.

The coupling between matter and space-time is achieved via algebraic source terms. The numerical scheme used for the solution of the new monolithic first order formulation is a path-conservative central WENO (CWENO) finite difference scheme, with suitable insertions to account for the presence of the non--conservative terms. By solving several crucial tests of numerical general relativity, including a stable neutron star, Riemann problems in relativistic matter with shock waves and the stable long-time evolution of single and binary puncture black holes up and beyond the binary merger, we show that our new CWENO scheme, introduced two decades ago for the compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics, can be successfully applied also to numerical general relativity, solving all equations at the same time with one single numerical method.

Quasi-normal mode frequencies and gravitational perturbations of black holes with any subextremal spin in modified gravity through METRICS: the scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity case,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11986v1,"Adrian Ka-Wai Chung, Nicolas Yunes","The gravitational waves emitted in the ringdown phase of binary black-hole coalescence are a unique probe of strong gravity. Understanding how deviations from general relativity affect the ringdown phase of black holes, however, is extremely challenging, as it requires solving highly-coupled and sometimes higher-order partial differential equations. We here extend a novel approach, \textit{Metric pErTuRbations wIth speCtral methodS} (METRICS), to study the metric perturbations and the quasinormal mode frequencies of ringing black holes in modified gravity. We first derive the asymptotic behavior of metric perturbations at the event horizon and spatial infinity for rotating black holes beyond general relativity. We then extend the eigenvalue-perturbation theory approach of METRICS to allow us to compute the leading-order modified gravity corrections to the quasinormal-mode frequencies and metric perturbations. We apply METRICS to rotating black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. Without decoupling or simplifying the linearized field equations in this theory, we compute the leading-order corrections to the quasinormal frequencies of the axial and polar perturbations of the $nlm = 022$, 021 and 033 modes of black holes of $a \leq 0.85$. The numerical accuracy of the METRICS frequencies is $\leq 10^{-5}$ for $a \leq 0.6$, $\lesssim 10^{-4}$ for $0.6 < a \leq 0.7 $, and $\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for $0.7 < a \leq 0.85 $ for all modes studied. We fit the frequencies as a polynomial in spin, whose coefficients (up to second order in spin) are consistent with those obtained in previous slow-rotating approximations. These results are the first accurate computations of the gravitational quasinormal-mode frequencies of rapidly rotating black holes (of $a \sim 0.85$) in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.",{'black holes': 6},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Close Encounter of Three Black Holes III,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11985v1,"Giuseppe Ficarra, Carlos O.

We find that the merger time of the binary gets a delay (with a number of orbits to merger increase), depending strongly with the distance to the orbiting third hole $D$ as $\sim1/D^{1.6\pm0.1}$. Notably, a different dependence from what we had found in the nonspinning case, $\sim1/D^{2.5}$. We interpret this effect as mostly due to a spin-orbit coupling between the third hole and the closest member of the binary in the successive approaches. This lead us next to study scattering configurations of the third hole with the binary in order to evaluate the extent of this ``sudden'' interactions, finding also a correlation of the delay in merger times with the closest distance, even for the nonspinning cases. We then explore the mass ratio dependence of the triple system by modeling binaries orbiting a larger black hole bearing masses ratios 8:1:1 and 18:1:1 in co-orbiting or counter-orbiting configurations, finding merger times increasing with increasing mass ratios and for the counter-orbiting cases.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

In the last decades, Galactic black holes in X-ray binaries (BHXBs) have been proposed as candidate sources of CRs revising the CR paradigm. BHXBs launch two relativistic jets during outbursts, but recent observations suggest that such jets may be launched even during quiescence. A0620-00 is such a well-studied object that shows hints of jet emission. In this work, we study the simultaneous radio-to-X-ray spectrum detected from this source while in quiescence to better constrain the jet dynamics. Given that the majority of BHXBs spend their lifetime in quiescence (qBHXBs), we use the jet dynamics of A0620-00 to study a population of 100000 such sources distributed throughout the Galactic disc, and a further 10000 located in the Boxy Bulge around the Galactic centre. While the contribution to the CR spectrum is suppressed, we find that the cumulative intrinsic emission of qBHXBs from both the Boxy Bulge and the Galactic disc adds to the diffuse emission that various facilities detect from radio to TeV gamma rays.

Stripping Quantum Decision Diagrams of their Identity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11959v1,"Aaron Sander, Ioan-Albert Florea, Lukas Burgholzer, Robert Wille","Classical representations of quantum states and operations as vectors and matrices are plagued by an exponential growth in memory and runtime requirements for increasing system sizes. Based on their use in classical computing, an alternative data structure known as Decision Diagrams (DDs) has been proposed, which, in many cases, provides both a more compact representation and more efficient computation. In the classical realm, decades of research have been conducted on DDs and numerous variations tailored for specific applications exist. However, DDs for quantum computing are just in their infancy and there is still room for tailoring them to this new technology. In particular, existing representations of DDs require extending all operations in a quantum circuit to the full system size through extension by nodes representing identity matrices. In this work, we make an important step forward for quantum DDs by stripping these identity structures from quantum operations. This significantly reduces the number of nodes required to represent them as well as eases the pressure on key building blocks of their implementation. As a result, we obtain a structure that is more natural for quantum computing and significantly speeds up with computations-with a runtime improvement of up to 70x compared to the state-of-the-art.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

New construction of a vacuum doubly rotating black ring by the Ehlers transformation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11804v1,"Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa","Using the Ehlers transformation, we derive an exact solution for a doubly rotating black ring in five-dimensional vacuum Einstein theory. It is well-known that the vacuum Einstein theory with three commuting Killing vector fields can be reduced to a non-linear sigma model with $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ target space symmetry. As shown previously by Giusto and Saxena, the $SO(2,1)$ subgroup in the $SL(3,{\mathbb R})$ can generate a rotating solution from a static solution while preserving asymptotic flatness. This so-called Ehlers transformation actually transforms the five-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole into the five-dimensional Myers-Perry black hole. However, unlike the case with the black hole, applying this method directly to the static black ring or the Emparan-Reall black ring, does not yield a regular rotating black ring due to the emergence of a Dirac-Misner string singularity. To solve this undesirable issue, we use a singular vacuum solution of a rotating black ring/lens that already possesses a Dirac-Misner string singularity as the seed solution for the Ehlers transformation. The resulting solution is regular, indicating the absence of curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities, Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and outside the horizon. We show that this solution obtained by the Ehlers transformation coincides precisely with the Pomeransky-Sen'kov solution.

We establish an approximate correspondence between the quasinormal modes and grey-body factors, which becomes exact in the high-frequency (eikonal) regime. We show that, in the eikonal regime, the grey-body factors of spherically symmetric black holes can be remarkably simply expressed via the fundamental quasinormal mode, while at smaller l, the correction terms include values of the overtones. This might be interesting in the context of the recently observed connection between grey-body factors and the amplitudes of gravitational waves from black holes. The correspondence might explain why grey-body factors are more stable, i.e. less sensitive, than higher overtones to small deformation of the effective potential.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

The presented generation of ExaGRyPE solves the Einstein equations in the CCZ4 formulation under a 3+1 foliation and focuses on black hole spacetimes. It employs a block-structured Cartesian grid carrying a higher-order order Finite Difference scheme with adaptive mesh refinement, it facilitates massive parallelism combining message passing, domain decomposition and task parallelism, and it supports the injection of particles into the grid as data probes or tracers. We introduce the ExaGRyPE-specific building blocks within ExaHyPE 2, and discuss its software architecture and compute-n-feel:
  For this, we formalize the creation of any specific simulation with ExaGRyPE as a sequence of lowering operations, where abstract logical tasks are successively broken into finer tasks until we obtain an abstraction level that can be mapped onto a C++ executable. The overall program logic is fully specified via a domain-specific Python interface, we map this logic onto a more detailed set of numerical tasks, subsequently lower this representation onto technical tasks that the underlying ExaHyPE engine uses to parallelize the application, before eventually the technical tasks are mapped onto task graphs including the actual PDE term evaluations, initial conditions, boundary conditions, and so forth. We end up with a rigorous separation of concerns which shields ExaGRyPE users from technical details and hence simplifies the development of novel physical models. We present the simulations and data for the gauge wave, static single black holes and rotating binary black hole systems, demonstrating that the code base is mature and usable. However, we also uncover domain-specific numerical challenges that need further study by the community in future work.","{'black holes': 1, 'einstein equations': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Preparing an initial state for specific applications can considerably reduce the cost of probabilistic algorithms such as the well studied quantum phase estimation (QPE). Fortunately, in the application space of quantum chemistry, generating approximate wave functions for molecular systems is well studied, and quantum computing algorithms stand to benefit from importing these classical methods directly into a quantum circuit. In this work, we propose a state preparation method based on coupled cluster (CC) theory, which is a pillar of quantum chemistry on classical computers, by incorporating mid-circuit measurements into the circuit construction. Currently, the most well studied state preparation method for quantum chemistry on quantum computers is the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) with a unitary-CC with single- and double-electron excitation terms (UCCSD) ansatz whose operations are limited to unitary gates. We verify the accuracy of our state preparation protocol using mid-circuit measurements by performing energy evaluation and state overlap computation for a set of small chemical systems. We further demonstrate that our approach leads to a reduction of the classical computation overhead, and the number of CNOT and T gates by 28% and 57% on average when compared against the standard VQE-UCCSD protocol.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In this system, the charge of the D(-1) brane as the D-instanton gives the gluon condensate. To simplify the holographic setup, we first reduce briefly the ten-dimensional supergravity background produced by D(-1)-D3-branes to an equivalently five-dimensional background. Then using the standard method for computing the Green function in the AdS/CFT dictionary, we derive the equations for the fermionic correlation functions and solve them numerically with the infalling boundary condition. Our numerical results illustrate that the fermionic correlation function as spectral function includes two branches of the dispersion curves whose behavior is very close to the results obtained from the method of hard thermal loop. And the effective mass generated by the medium effect of fermion splits into two values due to the spin-dependent interactions induced by instantons.

We use the Lasair transient broker to search Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data for transients lasting more than one year and exhibiting smooth declines. Our search returns 59 events, seven of which we classify as ANTs assumed to be driven by accretion onto supermassive black holes. We propose the remaining 52 are stochastic variability from regular supermassive black hole accretion rather than distinct transients. We supplement the seven ANTs with three nuclear transients in ZTF that fail the light curve selection but have clear single flares and spectra that do not resemble typical AGN. All but one of these 10 ANTs have a mid-infrared flare from an assumed dust echo, implying the ubiquity of dust around the black holes giving rise to ANTs. No events are more luminous than AT2021lwx, but one (ZTF19aamrjar) has twice the duration and a higher integrated energy release. On the other extreme, ZTF20abodaps reaches a luminosity close to AT2021lwx with a rise time $<20$ d and that fades smoothly in $>600$ d. We define a portion of rise-time versus flare amplitude space that selects ANTs with $\sim50$ per cent purity against variable active galactic nuclei.

Unbounded sequential multipartite nonlocality via violation of Mermin inequality,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11466v1,"Bang-Zhu Shen, Mao-Sheng Li","Quantum nonlocality is a significant feature in quantum information theory, prompting recent investigations into the potential reuse of post-measurement states to uncover nonlocality among sequentially measuring observers.

We explore sequential nonlocality in systems comprising more parties and observer chains. Our findings reveal that in $n$-partite systems, regardless of whether it is a single-chain or double-chain scenario, there exist unbounded sequential observers capable of detecting nonlocality through violations of the Mermin inequality. In contrast to the conjecture that sequential Bell nonlocality cannot manifest with multiple Alices and Bobs in bipartite systems (i.e., the double-chain setting)[Phys. Rev.

Attention-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Qubit Allocation in Modular Quantum Architectures,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11452v1,"Enrico Russo, Maurizio Palesi, Davide Patti, Giuseppe Ascia, Vincenzo Catania","Modular, distributed and multi-core architectures are currently considered a promising approach for scalability of quantum computing systems. The integration of multiple Quantum Processing Units necessitates classical and quantum-coherent communication, introducing challenges related to noise and quantum decoherence in quantum state transfers between cores. Optimizing communication becomes imperative, and the compilation and mapping of quantum circuits onto physical qubits must minimize state transfers while adhering to architectural constraints. The compilation process, inherently an NP-hard problem, demands extensive search times even with a small number of qubits to be solved to optimality. To address this challenge efficiently, we advocate for the utilization of heuristic mappers that can rapidly generate solutions. In this work, we propose a novel approach employing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to learn these heuristics for a specific multi-core architecture. Our DRL agent incorporates a Transformer encoder and Graph Neural Networks. It encodes quantum circuits using self-attention mechanisms and produce outputs through an attention-based pointer mechanism that directly signifies the probability of matching logical qubits with physical cores. This enables the selection of optimal cores for logical qubits efficiently. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed method can outperform baseline approaches in terms of reducing inter-core communications and minimizing online time-to-solution.

Ge, et. al., Phys. Rev. X 14, 021025 (2024)) has sparked significant interest. At a phenomenological level, the order parameter of the $3Q$ pair-density-wave state can form either a triangular lattice or a kagome lattice, in which the vortices and antivortices locate at the center of the plaquettes. When the phase of a Cooper pair is denoted as a XY spin, the effective model for the phase fluctuation is characterized by the frustrated XY spin model on a triangular lattice with the nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic coupling or a kagome lattice with both nearest neighbour and next-nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings. While both models produce $\frac{1}{3}$ fractional vortex excitations, which arise as the kinks on the domain walls in the low-energy excitations, the triangular lattice model has a much larger domain wall energy than the vortex interaction energy, so the frustrated kagome lattice model becomes unique. By developing a state-of-the-art numerical tensor network method, we rigorously solve this effective model at finite temperatures and confirm the presence of a vestigial phase with $\frac{1}{3}$ vortex-antivortex paired phase in the absence of phase coherence of Cooper pairs, which is dual to the charge-$6e$ condensed phase. Our theory provides a potential explanation for the vestigial charge-$6e$ magneto-resistant oscillations observed in the recent experimental work.",{'tensor network': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Tensor Networks']

Enhancing noise characterization with robust time delay interferometry combination,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11305v2,Gang Wang,"Time delay interferometry (TDI) is essential for suppressing laser frequency noise and achieving the targeted sensitivity for space-borne gravitational wave (GW) missions.

The results showed that both TDI schemes have comparable performances in mitigating laser and clock noises. However, when analyzing chirp signal from the coalescence of massive binary black holes, the Michelson configuration becomes inferior due to its vulnerable T channel and numerous null frequencies. In contrast, the hybrid Relay is more robust in dynamic unequal-arm scenarios. In this work, we further investigate the noise characterization capabilities of these two TDI configurations. Our investigations demonstrate that hybrid Relay achieves more robust noise parameter inference than the Michelson configuration. Moreover, the performance could be enhanced by replacing the T channel of hybrid Relay with the null stream from Sagnac configuration. The combined data streams, two science observables from the hybrid Relay and a null observable from the Sagnac, could form an optimal dataset for characterizing noises.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
No evidence for a dip in the binary black hole mass spectrum,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11111v1,"Christian Adamcewicz, Paul D. Lasky, Eric Thrane, Ilya Mandel","Stellar models indicate that the core compactness of a star, which is a common proxy for its explodability in a supernova, does not increase monotonically with the star's mass. Rather, the core compactness dips sharply over a range of carbon-oxygen core masses; this range may be somewhat sensitive to the star's metallicity and evolutionary history. Stars in this compactness dip are expected to experience supernovae leaving behind neutron stars, whereas stars on either side of this range are expected to form black holes. This results in a hypothetical mass range in which black holes should seldom form. Quantitatively, when applied to binary stripped stars, these models predict a dearth of binary black holes with component masses $\approx 10 M_\odot - 15 M_\odot$. The population of gravitational-wave signals indicates weak evidence for a dip in the distribution of chirp masses of merging binary black holes near $\approx 10 M_\odot - 12 M_\odot$. This feature could be linked to the hypothetical component mass gap described above, but this interpretation depends on what assumptions are made of the binaries' mass ratios. Here, we directly probe the distribution of binary black hole component masses to look for evidence of a gap. We find no evidence for this feature using data from the third gravitational-wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3). If this gap does exist in nature, we find that it is unlikely to be resolvable by the end of the current (fourth) LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observing run.",{'black holes': 4},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Exact black hole solutions in scalar-tensor theories,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11095v1,Nicolas Lecoeur,"General Relativity allows for a unique black hole solution, characterized by its mass M, angular momentum J, and electric charge Q. Black holes in General Relativity are thus said to have no hair, that is, no other independent physical quantity (no-hair theorem). Despite the numerous successes of General Relativity, some limitations remain, like the central singularity possessed by black holes, where the curvature of spacetime becomes infinite. Modified theories of gravity try to solve some of these shortcomings. This thesis tests the no-hair theorem in a popular modification of gravity, called scalar-tensor theories, where a unique degree of freedom (a scalar field) is added on top of the usual metric of spacetime of General Relativity. Using various symmetries, new black holes, called hairy black holes, are obtained. Some of them evade strongly the no-hair theorem, being characterized by a new quantity (primary scalar hair), distinct from M, J or Q. An interesting progress is also achieved, since in certain cases, the usual singularity disappears: the curvature of spacetime remains bounded even at the core of the black hole. Moreover, theoretical links are established between scalar-tensor theories (which take place in the usual four dimensions of spacetime), and theories of gravity in higher dimensions, by Kaluza-Klein reduction. Finally, certain particular properties of scalar-tensor theories enable to transform initial black hole solutions into other solutions with very distinct geometry, like wormholes or non-stationary black holes.",{'black holes': 5},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Counter to expectation, we demonstrate that QNMs not only persist in finite-sized systems, but the number of accessible modes increases. Furthermore, we show that QNMs in this set-up can be easily excited by incoherent background noise.

By investigating the reverse and forward shock dynamics due to the interaction between the jets and AGN disk material, we find that the relativistic jets can successfully break out from the disks only for a sufficiently high luminosity and a long enough duration. In comparison, relatively normal GRB jets are inclined to be choked in the disks, unless the GRBs occur near an SMBH with relatively low mass (e.g., $\sim 10^6M_{\odot}$).

As this effect provides negative energy density, it can be utilized as an ideal candidate for the exotic matter required for creating a traversable wormhole. In the context of modified theories of gravity such as Brans-Dicke (BD) theory \cite{BDTH}, wormhole geometries {have} been vastly investigated{. However}, the scientific literature is silent on the issue of BD wormholes in the presence of Casimir energy. Our aim in the present study is to seek for static spherically symmetric solutions representing wormhole configurations in BD theory with Casimir energy as the supporting matter. The Casimir {setup} we assume comprises two electrically neutral, infinitely large parallel planes placed in a vacuum. We then consider the Casimir vacuum energy density of a scalar field in such a configuration with Dirichlet {and} mixed boundary conditions. In the former case, the corresponding Casimir force is attractive and in the latter this force is repulsive. We present exact zero tidal force wormhole solutions as well as those with non-vanishing redshift function for both types of Casimir energies. The conditions on wormhole solutions along with the weak (WEC) and null (NEC) energy conditions put constraints on the values of BD coupling parameter. These constraints are also subject to the value of BD scalar field at the throat and the throat radius. We therefore find that BD wormholes in the presence of Casimir energy can exist without violating NEC and WEC (for the repulsive Casimir force).

This study analyzes eight LRDs from the CEERS survey, utilizing NIRCam and MIRI photometry. By performing SED fitting across a vast parameter space, we explore a broad range of AGN fractions, defined as the ratio of the monochromatic luminosities (AGN, galaxy, and dust) at 0.53 $μm$ rest-frame. We find that the SEDs of all the LRDs investigated are consistent with having significant AGN contributions, with the best-fitting AGN fractions ranging between 40% and 85%. Moreover, assuming these LRDs do indeed host AGN, we can place limits on their black hole masses using the inferred AGN bolometric luminosities and adopting the Eddington limit. We find that, independent of the specific AGN fraction adopted, the LRDs' black holes are significantly overmassive relative to their host galaxies -- by $\sim 2$ dex, and up to $\sim 4$ dex in the most extreme cases -- compared to the local $M_{\bullet} - M_{\star}$ relation.

Here we make the first steps towards a theory of MPU with uniform bulk but arbitrary boundary. In particular, we study the structure of a subclass with a direct-sum form which maximally violates the QCA property. We also consider the general case of MPU formed by site-dependent (nonuniform) tensors and show a correspondence between MPU and locally maximally entanglable states.",{'tensor networks': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Tensor Networks']
High-Entanglement Capabilities for Variational Quantum Algorithms: The Poisson Equation Case,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10156v1,"Fouad Ayoub, James D. Baeder","The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) is vital to the field of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and an algorithm that solves it on a quantum computer could potentially grant exponential space and time complexity speedups. However, the DPEM in 1D has been shown to have trouble being represented as a decomposition in the Pauli basis. Additionally, traditional ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have large numbers of parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing the IonQ Aria quantum computer capabilities that boast all-to-all connectivity of qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have $O(1)$ terms with respect to system size, with one term having an $O(n^2)$ circuit depth and the rest having only an $O(1)$ circuit depth (where $n$ is the number of qubits defining the system size). To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an $O(n)$ scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence, providing an exponential speedup over their classical computing counterparts. This project shows that the future of computational fluid dynamics may involve quantum computers to provide significant time and space complexity speedups.",{'quantum computer': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

It will also measure black hole spins, study the energy extraction and acceleration mechanisms for black hole jets, and characterize the black hole mass distribution. BHEX achieves high angular resolution by joining with ground-based millimeter-wavelength VLBI arrays, extending the size, and therefore improving the angular resolution of the earthbound telescopes.

BHEX receiver front end will observe simultaneously with dual polarizations in two bands, one sampling 80-106 GHz and one sampling 240-320 GHz. An ultra-stable quartz oscillator provides the master frequency reference and ensures coherence for tens of seconds. To achieve the required sensitivity, the front end will instantaneously receive 32 GHz of frequency bandwidth, which will be digitized to 64 Gbits/sec of incompressible raw data. These data will be buffered and transmitted to the ground via laser data link, for correlation with data recorded simultaneously at radio telescopes on the ground.

Quasinormal modes of slowly-spinning horizonless compact objects,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.10070v2,"M. V. S. Saketh, Elisa Maggio","One of the main predictions of general relativity is the existence of black holes featuring a horizon beyond which nothing can escape. Gravitational waves from the remnants of compact binary coalescences have the potential to probe new physics close to the black hole horizons. This prospect is of particular interest given several quantum-gravity models that predict the presence of horizonless and singularity-free compact objects. The membrane paradigm is a generic framework that allows one to parametrise the interior of compact objects in terms of the properties of a fictitious fluid located at the object's radius. It has been used to derive the quasinormal mode spectrum of static horizonless compact objects. Extending the membrane paradigm to rotating objects is crucial to constrain the properties of the spinning merger remnants. In this work, we extend the membrane paradigm to linear order in spin and use it to analyse the relationships between the quasi-normal modes, the object's reflectivity, and the membrane parameters. We find a breaking of isospectrality between axial and polar modes when the object is partially reflecting or the compactness differs from the black hole case. We also find that in reflective ultracompact objects some of the modes tend towards instability as the spin increases. Finally, we show that the spin enhances the deviations from the black-hole quasinormal mode spectrum as the compactness decreases. This implies that spinning horizonless compact objects may be more easily differentiated than nonspinning ones in the prompt ringdown.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Here, we tackle the case of 1D rings, aiming to promote singlet fission and prevent its back-reaction. We study ultrafast SF non-perturbatively, by numerically solving a spin-boson model, via exact propagation and tensor network methods.

The proposed algorithm has the flexibility to incorporate a large portion of the environment when performing low-rank approximations, which can lead to high accuracy for a given rank. Here, the environment refers to the remaining set of tensors in the network, and low-rank approximations with larger environments can generally provide higher accuracy. For contracting tensor networks defined on lattices, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as a generalization of the standard boundary-based algorithms. In addition, the algorithm includes a cost-efficient density matrix algorithm for approximating a tensor network with a general graph structure into a tree structure, whose computational cost is asymptotically upper-bounded by that of the standard algorithm that uses canonicalization.

Using analytical and lattice calculations, we find that primordial black hole production is far from being a generic outcome. Also, in most of the parameter space of viable inflationary models, the metric preheating term is subleading to the anharmonic terms and the approximation of a quadratic potential for describing the resonance dynamics is inadequate. Nonetheless, the anharmonicity of the potential cannot be used to rescue the mechanism: The generic outcome of the non-linear evolution of the scalar field in this case is the formation of metastable transients or oscillons, that do not generically collapse into black holes.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Bayesian Inference of General Noise Model Parameters from Surface Code&#39;s Syndrome Statistics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08981v1,"Takumi Kobori, Synge Todo","Active research on the surface code shows that its decoding performance can be significantly enhanced by utilizing the information of the noise model and optimizing the grid shape and decoding algorithm. Usually, the parameters in the noise model for the quantum error correction code must be prepared separately using some method, such as the quantum process tomography. There is a strong need to perform noise model estimation in parallel with the syndrome measurement during decoding to avoid the demanding prior tomography procedure. While noise model estimation based on syndrome measurement statistics is well-explored for Pauli noise, it remains under-studied for more complex noise models like amplitude damping. In this paper, we propose general noise model Bayesian inference methods that integrate the surface code's tensor network simulator, which can efficiently simulate various noise models, with Monte Carlo sampling techniques. For stationary noise, where the noise parameters are constant and do not change, we propose a method based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo. For time-varying noise, which is a more realistic situation, we introduce another method based on the sequential Monte Carlo. We present the numerical results of applying the proposed methods to various noise models, such as static, time-varying, and non-uniform cases, and evaluate their performance in detail.",{'tensor network': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Tensor Networks']

Unlike DQAS, each placeholder is independent, while the self-attention mechanism in SA-DQAS helps to capture relation and dependency information among each operation candidate placed on placeholders in a circuit. To evaluate and verify, we conduct experiments on job-shop scheduling problems (JSSP), Max-cut problems, and quantum fidelity. Incorporating self-attention improves the stability and performance of the resulting quantum circuits and refines their structural design with higher noise resilience and fidelity.

Frozen boson stars in an infinite tower of higher-derivative gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08813v1,"Tian-Xiang Ma, Yong-Qiang Wang","In this paper, we present a solution for a five-dimensional boson star under gravity with infinite tower of higher curvature corrections. We discover that when the coupling constant exceeds a certain threshold, an alternative configuration emerges, distinct from the conventional five-dimensional boson star. This new structure is characterized by a broader frequency range, with its minimum value approaching zero. At a truncation of $n=2$ for the correction order, the solution and its scalar curvature diverge as the frequency approaches zero. However, as the order of higher curvature corrections increases, the singularity at the center vanishes, resulting in a globally regular solution. Additionally, as the frequency approaches zero, the scalar field's radial distribution becomes concentrated within the critical radius $r_c$, forming what we term a ``frozen star"". Beyond this radius, the metric of the frozen star almost degenerates into that of an extreme black hole. The solutions for such frozen stars offer a new avenue for exploring the enigmatic interiors of compact celestial bodies, enhancing our understanding of the internal structure of black holes under semi-classical conditions and potentially addressing the series of paradoxes associated with information loss due to singularities and horizons.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

In this paper, we analyze the topological properties of the charged AdS black holes in the restricted phase space under the higher dimensions and higher order curvature gravities frame. The results show that the topological number of the charged black hole in the same canonical ensembles is a constant and is independent of the concrete dual thermodynamical parameters.

A New Model-Independent Precision Test of General Relativity using LISA Bright Standard Sirens,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08791v1,"Samsuzzaman Afroz, Suvodip Mukherjee","The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), set for launch in the mid-2030s, will enhance our capability to probe the universe through gravitational waves (GWs) emitted from binary black holes (BBHs) across a broad range of cosmological distances. LISA is projected to observe three classes of BBHs: massive BBHs (MBBHs), extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and stellar mass BBHs. This study focuses on MBBHs, which are anticipated to occur in gas-rich environments conducive to producing powerful electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. This capability to precisely localize MBH events in the sky positions them as excellent candidates for bright sirens. By combining GW luminosity distance measurements from these bright sirens with Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements derived from galaxy clustering and sound horizon measurements from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), we propose a data-driven model-independent method to reconstruct deviations in the variation of the effective Planck mass (in conjunction with the Hubble constant) as a function of cosmic redshift. Using this multi-messenger technique, we achieve precise measurements of deviations in the effective Planck mass variation with redshift (z), with a precision ranging from approximately $2.4\%$ to $7.2\%$ from redshift $z=1$ to $z=6$ with a single event. Additionally, we achieved a measurement of the Hubble constant with a precision of about $1.3\%$, accounting for variations in the effective Planck mass over 4 years of observation time ($T_{\mathrm{obs}}$). This assumes that EM counterparts are detected for $75\%$ of the events. This precision improves with observation time as $T_{\mathrm{obs}}^{-1/2}$. This approach not only has the potential to reveal deviations from General Relativity but also to significantly expand our understanding of the universe's fundamental physical properties.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Recently, a systematic construction of such perturbations based on the so-called long-range deformations of integrable chains was formulated. These perturbations, obtained as truncations of the long-range deformations in some small parameter expansions, can be viewed as produced by unitary rotations of the short-range integrable models. For infinite systems, several ''generators'' (extensive local, boosted, and bilocal operators) of weak perturbations are known. The main aim of this work is to understand the appropriate generators in finite systems with periodic boundaries since simple counterparts to boosted and bilocal operators are not known in such cases. We approach this by studying the structure of the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), a proxy for such generators in finite chains, which was originally introduced as a very sensitive measure of quantum chaos. We prove an exact relation between the AGPs for the boosted and bilocal classes of generators and note that the counterpart to boost does not seem to have a closed analytic form in finite systems but shows quasi-locality nonetheless.

Primordial magnetic relics and their signatures,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08728v1,"Arka Banerjee, Lalit Singh Bhandari, Ashwat Jain, Arun M.

They could, therefore, conceivably contribute to a component of dark matter. We investigate novel Faraday rotation signatures exhibited by primordial magnetic black holes while also establishing new Parker-type bounds on their populations. For the latter, we bound the dark matter fraction from intergalactic magnetic fields in cosmic voids $\left(f_{\text{DM}} \lesssim 10^{-8}\right)$ and cosmic web filaments $\left(f_{\text{ DM}} \lesssim 10^{-4}\right)$, notably eclipsing previous bounds. Exploring Faraday rotation effects, we discern a pronounced rotation of the polarization angle and the rotation measure values for extremal primordial magnetic black holes with masses $M^{\text{ ex.}}_{\text{ BH}}\gtrsim 10^{-6}~ \text{M}_\odot$. This makes them potentially detectable in current observations. A comparative investigation finds that the effects are notably greater than for a neutron star, like a Magnetar, with a similar magnetic field at the surface. Moreover, the polarization angle maps for primordial magnetic black holes exhibit unique features, notably absent in other astrophysical magnetic configurations. In this context, we also introduce a simple integral measure, offering a quantitative measure for their discrimination in many scenarios. These traits potentially suggest a robust avenue for their observational detection and differentiation.","{'black holes': 4, 'hawking radiation': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Whispering in the dark: faint X-ray emission from black holes with OB star companions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.08596v1,"Koushik Sen, Ileyk El Mellah, Norbert Langer, Xiao-Tian Xu, Martin Quast, Daniel Pauli","Context. Recent astrometric and spectroscopic surveys of OB stars have revealed a few stellar-mass black holes (BHs) with orbital periods as low as 10 days. No X-ray counterpart has been detected, due to the absence of a radiatively efficient accretion disk around the BH. Yet, dissipative processes in the hot, dilute and strongly magnetized plasma around the BH (so-called BH corona) can still lead to non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g. synchrotron).
  Aims. We determine the X-ray luminosity distribution from BH+OB star binaries up to orbital periods of a few thousand days.
  Methods. We use detailed binary evolution models computed with MESA for initial primary masses of 10-90 $M_{\odot}$ and orbital periods from 1-3000 d. The X-ray luminosity is computed for a broad range of radiative efficiencies.
  Results. We show that particle acceleration through magnetic reconnection can heat the BH corona. A substantial fraction of the gravitational potential energy from the accreted plasma is converted into non-thermal X-ray emission. Our population synthesis analysis predicts at least 28 (up to 72) BH+OB star binaries in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to produce X-ray luminosity above 10$^{31}$ erg$\,$s$^{-1}$, observable through focused Chandra observations. We identify a population of SB1 systems in the LMC and HD96670 in the Milky Way comprising O stars with unseen companions of masses above 2.3 $M_{\odot}$ that aligns well with our predictions. The predicted luminosities of the OB companions to these X-ray-emitting BHs are 10$^{4.5-5.5}$ $L_{\odot}$.
  Conclusions. These results make the case for long-time exposure in X-rays of the stellar-mass BH candidates identified around OB stars. It will constrain the underlying population of X-ray-faint BHs, the evolution from single to double degenerate binaries, and the progenitors of gravitational wave mergers.

This training state encodes the probability distribution of the dataset in a quantum state, such that the density of a new sample can be estimated by projecting its corresponding quantum state onto the training state.

To address this, we derive two distinct quantum speed limits in Liouville space for Completely Positive and Trace-Preserving (CPTP) dynamics that outperform previous bounds. The first bound saturates for time-optimal CPTP dynamics, while the second bound is exact for all states and all CPTP dynamics. Our bounds have a clear physical and geometric interpretation arising from the uncertainty of superoperators and the geometry of quantum evolution in Liouville space. They can be regarded as the generalization of the Mandelstam-Tamm bound, providing uncertainty relations between time, energy, and dissipation for open quantum dynamics. Additionally, our bounds are significantly simpler to estimate and experimentally more feasible as they require to compute or measure the overlap of density matrices and the variance of the Liouvillian. We have also obtained the form of the Liouvillian, which generates the time-optimal (fastest) CPTP dynamics for given initial and final states. We give two important applications of our bounds. First, we show that the speed of evolution in Liouville space bounds the growth of the spectral form factor and Krylov complexity of states, which are crucial for studying information scrambling and quantum chaos. Second, using our bounds, we explain the Mpemba effect in non-equilibrium open quantum dynamics.",{'quantum chaos': 1},06.2024,2024,06,[]

If those dark-sector particles are stable, they would survive to the present day as ""Hawking relics"" and modify the subsequent growth of cosmological structure. We show that such relics are produced with much larger momenta, but in smaller quantities than the familiar thermal relics considered in standard cosmology. Consequently, Hawking relics with keV-MeV masses affect the growth of large-scale structure in a similar way to eV-scale thermal relics like massive neutrinos. We model their production and evolution, and show that their momentum distributions are broader than comparable relics with thermal distributions. Warm Hawking relics affect the growth of cosmological perturbations and we constrain their abundance to be less than $2\%$ of the dark matter over a broad range of their viable parameter space.

We report a distributed version of the UF decoder that exploits parallel computing resources for further speedup. Using an FPGA-based implementation, we empirically show that this distributed UF decoder has a sublinear average time complexity with regard to $d$, given $O(d^3)$ parallel computing resources. The decoding time per measurement round decreases as $d$ increases, the first time for a quantum error decoder. The implementation employs a scalable architecture called Helios that organizes parallel computing resources into a hybrid tree-grid structure. Using a Xilinx VCU129 FPGA, we successfully implement $d$ up to 21 with an average decoding time of 11.5 ns per measurement round under 0.1\% phenomenological noise, and 23.7 ns for $d=17$ under equivalent circuit-level noise.

We obtain quasistationary scalar hair configurations in the test-field limit for black holes with linear/angular momentum as well as for black hole binaries. For isolated black holes, we explicitly show that the scalar profile obtained is stationary by evolving the system in time and compare against previous formulations of scalar Gauss-Bonnet initial data.

In particular, we analyse the death rates of stars of all masses, dying either quiescently or explosively.

Generating multipartite nonlocality to benchmark quantum computers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07659v1,"Jan Lennart Bönsel, Otfried Gühne, Adán Cabello","We show that quantum computers can be used for producing large $n$-partite nonlocality, thereby providing a method to benchmark them. The main challenges to overcome are: (i) The interaction topology might not allow arbitrary two-qubit gates. (ii) Noise limits the Bell violation. (iii) The number of combinations of local measurements grows exponentially with $n$. To overcome (i), we point out that graph states that are compatible with the two-qubit connectivity of the computer can be efficiently prepared. To mitigate (ii), we note that, for specific graph states, there are $n$-partite Bell inequalities whose resistance to white noise increases exponentially with $n$. To address (iii) for any $n$ and any connectivity, we introduce an estimator that relies on random sampling. As a result, we propose a method for producing $n$-partite Bell nonlocality with unprecedented large $n$. This allows in return to benchmark nonclassical correlations regardless of the number of qubits or the connectivity. We test our approach by using a simulation for a noisy IBM quantum computer, which predicts $n$-partite Bell nonlocality for at least $n=24$ qubits.",{'quantum computer': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In addition, we make use of the monitoring programs by the Zwicky Transient Facility and NEOWISE at optical and infrared wavelengths, respectively. We find that the source is particularly variable in the infrared band on daily time scales.

It has long been established that cold dark matter should form dense spikes around intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes due to adiabatic compression of the surrounding dark matter halo. Lighter black holes formed from stellar collapse, however, are not expected to develop such spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Given that primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this Letter we explore the possibility that these stellar-mass black holes may actually have a primordial origin.",{'black holes': 5},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Primordial Black Holes from First-Order Phase Transition in the xSM,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07622v1,"Dorival Gonçalves, Ajay Kaladharan, Yongcheng Wu","Supercooled first-order phase transition (FOPT) can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). This scenario imposes stringent requirements on the profile of the effective potential. In this work, we use the singlet extended Standard Model (xSM) as a benchmark model to investigate this possibility at the electroweak scale. The PBHs formed during a supercooled FOPT have a narrow mass distribution around the mass of Earth. This distribution is closely tied to the temperature at which the PBHs form, corresponding to the FOPT at the electroweak scale. This scenario can be probed with microlensing experiments, space-based gravitational wave detectors, and collider experiments. Remarkably, the future space-based gravitational wave detector LISA will hold the potential to either confirm this PBH scenario in the xSM or completely rule it out for extremely small total dark matter fraction made of PBHs, down to $f_{\rm PBH}> 10^{-300}$.

To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing design of quantum modulo $(2n+1)$ adder. In this work, we propose four quantum adders targeted specifically for modulo $(2n+1)$ addition. These adders can provide both regular and modulo $(2n+1)$ sum concurrently, enhancing their application in residue number system based arithmetic. Our first design, QMA1, is a novel quantum modulo $(2n+1)$ adder. The second proposed adder, QMA2, optimizes the utilization of quantum gates within the QMA1, resulting in 37.5% reduced CNOT gate count, 46.15% reduced CNOT depth, and 26.5% decrease in both Toffoli gates and depth. We propose a third adder QMA3 that uses zero resets, a dynamic circuits based feature that reuses qubits, leading to 25% savings in qubit count. Our fourth design, QMA4, demonstrates the benefit of incorporating additional zero resets to achieve a purer zero state, reducing quantum state preparation errors. Notably, we conducted experiments using 5-qubit configurations of the proposed modulo $(2n+1)$ adders on the IBM Washington, a 127-qubit quantum computer based on the Eagle R1 architecture, to demonstrate a 28.8% reduction in QMA1's error of which: (i) 18.63% error reduction happens due to gate and depth reduction in QMA2, and (ii) 2.53% drop in error due to qubit reduction in QMA3, and (iii) 7.64% error decreased due to application of additional zero resets in QMA4.",{'quantum computer': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07478v1,"Chi-Fang Chen, Jeongwan Haah, Jonas Haferkamp, Yunchao Liu, Tony Metger, Xinyu Tan","Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $Ω(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $Ω(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq Θ(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{Θ(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq Θ(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.

  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits.

Resummation of Multi-Stress Tensors in Higher Dimensions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.07458v1,Kuo-Wei Huang,"In the context of holographic conformal field theories (CFTs), a system of linear partial differential equations was recently proposed to be the higher-dimensional analogs of the null-state equations in $d=2$ CFTs at large central charge. Solving these equations in a near-lightcone expansion yields solutions that match the minimal-twist multi-stress tensor contributions to a heavy-light four-point correlator (or a thermal two-point correlator) computed using holography, the conformal bootstrap, and other methods. This note explores the exact solutions to these equations. We begin by observing that, in an expansion in terms of the ratio between the heavy operator's dimension and the central charge, the $d=2$ correlator involving the level-two degenerate scalars at each order can be represented as a Bessel function; the resummation yields the Virasoro vacuum block. We next observe a relation between the $d=2$ correlator and the $d=4$ near-lightcone correlator involving light scalars with the same conformal dimension. The resummed $d=4$ correlator takes a simple form in the complex frequency domain. Unlike the Virasoro vacuum block, the resummation in $d=4$ leads to essential singularities. Similar expressions are also obtained when the light scalar's dimension takes other finite values. These CFT results correspond to a holographic computation with a spherical black hole. In addition, using the differential equations, we demonstrate that the correlators can be reconstructed via certain modes. In $d=2$, these modes are related to the Virasoro algebra.","{'holography': 1, 'large central charge': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Holography']

Our algorithm successfully extracts the corresponding bulk metrics from these data. Additionally, we extend our methodology to many-body systems by employing entanglement entropy data from a fermionic tight-binding chain at half filling, exemplifying critical one-dimensional systems, and derive the associated bulk metric.

We illustrate the implementation of the HC$^d$-VCC in a quantum circuit using the quantum singular value transformation technique. Numerical simulations show that the C$^d$-VCC rapidly converges to the exact VCC with increasing truncation degree $d$, and the HC$^d$-VCC effectively reduces the Chebyshev expansion error compared to the C$^d$-VCC.

We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals.

At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error.

Inspired by this, we take into account a static and spherically symmetric magnetically charged regular black hole (MCRBH) metric characterized by its mass and an additional parameter q, which arises from the coupling of Einstein gravity and nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) in the weak field approximation. This parameterized model offers a robust foundation for testing the coupling of Einstein gravity and NLED in the weak-field approximation, using the EHT observational results. In this study, we investigate the geodesic motion of particles around the solution, followed by a discussion of its fundamental geometrical characteristics such as scalar invariants. Using null geodesics, we examine how the model parameter influences the behavior of the photon sphere radius and the associated shadow silhouette. We seek constraints on q by applying the EHT results for supermassive black holes M87* and Sgr A*. Furthermore, it is observed that the geodesics of time-like particles are susceptible to variations in q, which can have an impact on the traits of the innermost stable circular orbit and the marginally bounded orbit. Our primary objective is to probe how the free parameter q affects various aspects of the accretion disk surrounding the MCRBH using the thin-disk approximation.

Here, we numerically investigate the performance of quantum annealing (QA) and quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to find the solution of NPP that is encoded in the ground state of atomic qubits. We find the success probability of the standard QA decays rapidly with the problem size. The optimized annealing path or inhomogeneous driving fields only lead to mild improvement on the success probability. Similarly, the standard QAOA always gets trapped in a false local minimum, and there is no significant performance improvement as we increase the depth of the quantum circuit. Inspired by the counterdiabatic driving, we propose an adaptive ansatz of QAOA which releases the parameter freedom of the NPP Hamiltonian to match higher-order counterdiabatic terms. Through numerical simulations, we find that our adaptive QAOA can achieve the optimal solution within very small circuit depth. It is thus worth paying the extra optimization cost of additional parameters for improving QAOA performance.

Here we provide further evidence that the prescription works for larger kinematic regions than previously explored as well as a broader class of scattering amplitudes. Finally, we devise a new method for estimating the order of magnitude of the error associated with finite time separations needed for such calculations. In units of the lightest mass of the theory, we find that to constrain amplitudes using real-time methods within $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$, the spacetime volumes must satisfy $mL \sim \mathcal{O}(10-10^2)$ and $ mT\sim \mathcal{O}(10^2-10^4)$.",{'tensor networks': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Tensor Networks']
Simulations predict intermediate-mass black hole formation in globular clusters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06772v1,"Michiko S. Fujii, Long Wang, Ataru Tanikawa, Yutaka Hirai, Takayuki R. Saitoh","Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are those between 100 and 10$^5$ solar masses ($M_{\odot}$); their formation process is debated. One possible origin is the growth of less massive black holes (BHs) via mergers with stars and compact objects within globular clusters (GCs). However, previous simulations have indicated that this process only produces IMBHs $<500 M_{\odot}$ because the gravitational wave recoil ejects them when they merge with other BHs. We perform star-by-star simulations of GC formation, finding that high-density star formation in a GC's parent giant molecular cloud can produce sufficient mergers of massive stars to overcome that mass threshold. We conclude that GCs can form with IMBHs $\gtrsim 10^3 M_{\odot}$, which is sufficiently massive to be retained within the GC even with the expected gravitational wave recoil.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

We introduce a precise definition of ruled stretched Carrollian structures (sCarrollian structures) on any surface, generalizing the conventional Carrollian structures of null surfaces, along with the notions of sCarrollian connection and sCarrollian stress tensor. Our approach unifies the sCarrollian (intrinsic) and stretched horizon (embedding) perspectives, providing a universal framework for any causal surface, whether timelike or null. We express the Einstein equations in sCarrollian variables and discuss the phase space symplectic structure of the sCarrollian geometry. Through Noether's theorem, we derive the Einstein equation and canonical charge and compute the evolution of the canonical charge along the transverse (radial) direction. The latter can be interpreted as a spin-2 symmetry charge.
  Our framework establishes a novel link between gravity on stretched horizons and Carrollian fluid dynamics and unifies various causal surfaces studied in the literature, including non-expanding and isolated horizons. We expect this work to provide insights into the hydrodynamical description of black holes and the quantization of null surfaces.","{'black holes': 1, 'einstein equations': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Boundary operators in asymptotically flat space-time,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06690v2,Shamik Banerjee,"In arXiv:2311.03443 the authors have proposed an interesting framework for studying holography in flat space-time. In this note we explore the relationship between their proposal and the Celestial Holography. In particular, we find that in both the massive and in the massless cases the asymptotic boundary limit of the bulk time-ordered Green's function $G$ is related to the Celestial amplitudes by an integral transformation. In the massless case the integral transformation reduces to the well known \textit{shadow transformation} of the celestial amplitude. Now the relation between the asymptotic limit of $G$ and the celestial amplitudes suggests that in asymptotically flat space-time if the scattering states are described by the conformal primary basis (and it's analytic continuation in dimension $Δ$) then the boundary operators holographically dual to the (massless) bulk fields are given by the \underline{shadow transformation} of the conformal primary operators living on the celestial sphere. In other words, conformal primary operators themselves are not boundary operators but their shadows are. This is consistent with the fact that in celestial holography the boundary stress tensor is given by the shadow transformation of the subleading soft graviton.",{'holography': 3},06.2024,2024,06,['Holography']
Transient dynamics of quasinormal mode sums,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06685v1,"Javier Carballo, Benjamin Withers","Quasinormal modes of spacetimes with event horizons are typically governed by a non-normal operator. This gives rise to spectral instabilities, a topic of recent interest in the black hole pseudospectrum programme. In this work we show that non-normality leads to the existence of arbitrarily long-lived sums of short-lived quasinormal modes, corresponding to localising packets of energy near the future horizon. There exist sums of $M$ quasinormal modes whose lifetimes scale as $\log{M}$. This transient behaviour results from large cancellations between non-orthogonal quasinormal modes. We provide simple closed-form examples for a massive scalar field in the static patch of dS$_{d+1}$ and the BTZ black hole. We also provide numerical examples for scalar perturbations of Schwarzschild-AdS$_{d+1}$, and gravitational perturbations of Schwarzschild in asymptotically flat spacetime, using hyperboloidal foliations.

Systematic Collapse of the Accretion Disc Across the Supermassive Black Hole Population,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06674v1,"Scott Hagen, Chris Done, John D. Silverman, Junyao Li, Teng Liu, Wenke Ren, Johannes Buchner, Andrea Merloni, Tohru Nagao, Mara Salvato","The structure of the accretion flow onto supermassive black holes (SMBH) is not well understood. Standard disc models match to zeroth order in predicting substantial energy dissipation within optically-thick material producing a characteristic strong blue/UV continuum. However they fail at reproducing more detailed comparisons to the observed spectral shapes along with their observed variability. Based on stellar mass black holes within our galaxy, accretion discs should undergo a transition into an X-ray hot, radiatively inefficient flow, below a (mass scaled) luminosity of $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$. While this has been seen in limited samples of nearby low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a few rare changing-look AGN, it is not at all clear whether this transition is present in the wider AGN population across cosmic time. A key issue is the difficulty in disentangling a change in spectral state from increased dust obscuration and/or host galaxy contamination, effectively drowning out the AGN emission. Here we use the new eROSITA eFEDS Survey to identify unobscured AGN from their X-ray emission, matched to excellent optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam; allowing the subtraction of the host galaxy contamination. The resulting, uncontaminated, AGN spectra reveal a smooth transition from a strongly disc dominated state in bright AGN, to the collapse of the disc into an inefficient X-ray plasma in the low luminosity AGN, with the transition occurring at $\sim 0.02\,L_{\rm{Edd}}$; revealing fundamental aspects of accretion physics in AGN.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

The framework relies on numerical relativity predictions for the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant black holes. This proposed framework computes the masses, spins, and kicks imparted to the remnant of the parent binaries, given the initial masses and spin magnitudes of the binary constituents. We validate our approach by performing an ""injection study"" based on a constructed sequence of hierarchically-formed binaries. Noise is added to the final binary in the sequence, and the parameters of the 'parent' and 'grandparent' binaries in the merger chain are then reconstructed. This method is then applied to three GWTC-3 events: GW190521, GW200220_061928, GW190426_190642. These events were selected because at least one of the binary companions lies in the putative pair-instability supernova mass gap, in which stellar processes alone cannot produce black holes. Hierarchical mergers offer a natural explanation for the formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass-gap. We use the backward evolution framework to predict the parameters of the parents of the primary companion of these three binaries. Our results indicate that at least one component of these three observed binaries was formed through a prior binary black hole merger. This approach can be readily applied to future high-mass gravitational wave events to predict their formation history under the hierarchical merger assumption.",{'black holes': 4},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

The scientific utility is exemplified by a computation of nonequilibrium behavior of Ca$_3$Co$_2$O$_6$, which has been studied in the costly MagLab experiments. Specifically, an order of \$2M per material can be saved if an affordable quantum computer simulation is used to screen the materials before sending them to MagLab.

Additionally, we construct a moduli space for the set of stabilizer states, that is, a parameterization of this set, that endows it with a natural algebraic structure, and we derive a formula for the number of stabilizer states when $A$ is finite.

Our formalism enables us to separate the black hole mass function into sub-populations corresponding to mergers between objects formed via different astrophysical pathways, allowing us to infer the properties of black holes formed from stellar collapse and black holes formed via prior mergers separately. Applying this formalism, we find that this model fits the data better than the powerlaw+peak model with Bayes factor $ 9.7\pm0.1$. We measure the location of the lower edge of the upper black hole mass gap to be $M_{\rm BHMG}=84.05_{-12.88}^{+17.19}{\rm M}_{\odot}$, providing evidence that the $35{\rm M}_{\odot}$ Gaussian peak detected in the data using other models is not associated with the PPISN pile-up predicted to precede this gap. Incorporating spin, we find that the normalized spins of stellar remnant black holes are close to zero while those of higher generation black holes tend to larger values. All of these results are in accordance with the predictions of stellar structure theory and black hole merger scenarios. Finally, we combine our mass function with the spectral siren method for measuring the Hubble constant to find $H_0=36.19_{-10.91}^{17.50}$ km/s/Mpc and discuss potential explanations of this low value.

We investigate the role of these effects on the analogue black hole bomb, an instability resulting from rotational superradiant amplification in confined systems. We reveal that the dispersion of deep water capillary-gravity waves significantly modifies the unstable mode eigenfrequencies, whereas viscosity only affects those with high frequencies. Furthermore, if the circulation is less than an order 1 multiple of the drain rate, superradiance does not occur and the vortex is stable. The instability is maximised in small systems with high flow velocities, provided there is sufficient space between the vortex and the outer boundary for the first excited state to lie inside the superradiant bandwidth.

  We focus on the black hole case and derive recurrent formulas for all series coefficients of the infinite power-series expansion around the horizon. The solution is characterized by electric charge $q$, the black-hole radius $a_0$, and the Bach parameter $b$ related to the strength of the Bach tensor at the horizon. However, the Bach parameter has to be fine-tuned to ensure asymptotic flatness.

We further show that the exponential growth of OTOC associated with the physics of scrambling yields a power-law growth in the model for evaporating black holes which demonstrates a unitary dynamics in terms of a Page curve. We also demonstrate that, by tuning a parameter, one can naturally interpolate between an exponential growth associated to scrambling and a power-law growth in unitary dynamics.

Extensive studies have been conducted on the phase structure of numerous black holes, which have demonstrated striking similarities to the phase structure of various ordinary matter systems. A comparison of the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric AdS black holes with those of ordinary thermodynamic systems reveals that the isovolumetric heat capacity of the former is zero, whereas that of the latter is non-zero. It is a subject of interest for the intrinsic reason for this discrepancy. The effective thermodynamic quantities, based on the context of the boundary between the black hole horizon and the cosmological horizon in dS spacetime, as well as the interaction between the two horizons, are presented. The heat capacity in the Reissner-Nördstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) spacetime is then investigated, and it is demonstrated that the behavior of the heat capacity in the RN-dS spacetime is analogous to that of Schottky specific heat. Treating the two horizon interfaces in the RN-dS spacetime as two distinct energy levels in a two-energy system, and the thermodynamic properties in the RN-dS spacetime are discussed with the method of studying the thermodynamic properties in an ordinary two-energy system, to elucidate the intrinsic reasons for the occurrence of Schottky specific heat in the RN-dS spacetime. The heat capacity observed in the RN-dS spacetime is not only consistent with that of the Schottky specific heat described by the effective thermodynamic quantities in the RN-dS spacetime, but also with that of the heat capacity in an ordinary two-energy-level system. The quantum properties in the RN-dS spacetime are reflected, thereby providing a new avenue for further in-depth study of the quantum properties of black holes and dS spacetime.",{'black holes': 4},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

The RNS-based distributed quantum addition circuits possess lower depth and are distributed across multiple quantum computers/jobs, resulting in higher noise resilience.

Distant quasars provide unique information about the formation and evolution of the first galaxies and supermassive black holes in the Universe. Powerful relativistic jets are likely to have played an essential role in these processes. However, the sample of VLBI-observed radio quasars is still too small to allow meaningful statistical conclusions. We extend the list of the VLBI observed radio quasars to investigate how the source structure and physical parameters are related to radio loudness. We assembled a sample of 10 faint radio quasars located at 5 < z < 6 with their radio-loudness indices spanning between 0.9-76. We observed the selected targets with the European VLBI Network (EVN) at 1.7 GHz. The milliarcsecond-scale resolution of VLBI at this frequency allows us to probe the compact innermost parts of radio-emitting relativistic jets. In addition to the single-band VLBI observations, we collected single-dish and low-resolution radio interferometric data to investigate the spectral properties and variability of our sources. The detection rate of this high-redshift, low-flux-density sample is 90%, with only one target (J0306+1853) remaining undetected. The other 9 sources appear core-dominated and show a single, faint and compact radio core on this angular scale. The derived radio powers are typical of FRII radio galaxies and quasars.

This study not only extends the VQE algorithm to the relativistic regime, but also calculates a property other than energy, namely the molecular permanent electric dipole moment (PDM). We carry out 18-qubit quantum simulations to obtain ground state energies as well as PDMs of single-valence diatomic molecules, ranging from the light BeH to the heavy radioactive RaH molecule. We investigate the correlation trends in these systems as well as access the precision in our results.

Exotic compact objects: a recent numerical-relativity perspective,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04901v1,"Miguel Bezares, Nicolas Sanchis-Gual","Beyond black holes and neutron stars, new hypothetical compact objects have been proposed as potential astrophysical entities. In general, their properties have not yet been fully explored or understood, nor has it been proven whether or not they exist in nature. They are the so-called $\textit{exotic compact objects}$, theoretical equilibrium configurations in the strong regime of gravity that involve new exotic physical phenomena deeply related to fundamental questions of theoretical physics (e.g., the nature of dark matter, the formation of singularities, or the presence of horizons). Among these exotic objects, there are those that require the existence of new fields and particles beyond the Standard Model, such as boson stars and ultralight bosons; those that seek to describe the dense equation of state of neutron stars as an even more extreme state of matter made up of free quarks; or those that exhibit additional properties related to extensions of General Relativity or even quantum gravity. However, in order to move from theoretical objects to astrophysical objects, their dynamics and stability must first be assessed by performing numerical-relativity simulations under the premise that solutions that are unstable on dynamical timescales will never completely form, being, at most, a transient state that will not be able to play any astrophysical role. Furthermore, numerical simulations also make it possible to extract the gravitational radiation from relevant astrophysical scenarios, such as the collapse of exotic stars or binary mergers, which could then be compared with current and upcoming LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA gravitational-wave detections.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04764v1,"Myeonghwan Oh, Myeong-Gu Park","Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_γ\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Hot electrons are generated by biasing across a mesoscopic potential in {\it n}-type region and travel toward {\it p}-type region through quantum Hall edge channel in the presence of magnetic field perpendicular to the substrate. The {\it p}-type region is created several microns away from the hot electron emitter by inducing interfacial charges using a surface gate. The energy relaxation of the hot electrons is suppressed by separating the orbitals before and after longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon emission. This technique enables the hot electrons to reach the {\it p}-type region and to recombine with induced holes followed by photon emissions. Hot electron-induced hole recombination is confirmed by a peak around \qty{810}{nm} in an optical spectrum that corresponds to excitonic recombination in a \ce{GaAs} quantum well. An asymmetric structure observed in the optical spectrum as a function of the magnetic field originates from the chiral transport of the hot electrons in the Hall edge channel.

Geometric Quantum Machine Learning with Horizontal Quantum Gates,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04418v1,"Roeland Wiersema, Alexander F. Kemper, Bojko N. Bakalov, Nathan Killoran","In the current framework of Geometric Quantum Machine Learning, the canonical method for constructing a variational ansatz that respects the symmetry of some group action is by forcing the circuit to be equivariant, i.e., to commute with the action of the group. This can, however, be an overzealous constraint that greatly limits the expressivity of the circuit, especially in the case of continuous symmetries. We propose an alternative paradigm for the symmetry-informed construction of variational quantum circuits, based on homogeneous spaces, relaxing the overly stringent requirement of equivariance. We achieve this by introducing horizontal quantum gates, which only transform the state with respect to the directions orthogonal to those of the symmetry. We show that horizontal quantum gates are much more expressive than equivariant gates, and thus can solve problems that equivariant circuits cannot. For instance, a circuit comprised of horizontal gates can find the ground state of an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$-symmetric model where the ground state spin sector is unknown--a task where equivariant circuits fall short. Moreover, for a particular subclass of horizontal gates based on symmetric spaces, we can obtain efficient circuit decompositions for our gates through the KAK theorem. Finally, we highlight a particular class of horizontal quantum gates that behave similarly to general $\mathrm{SU}(4)$ gates, while achieving a quadratic reduction in the number of parameters for a generic problem.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Asymptotically Schwarzschild Solutions in $f(R)$ Extension of General Relativity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04417v1,"Federico Scali, Oliver Fabio Piattella","We address the question of how to build a class of $f(R)$ extensions of General Relativity which are compatible with solar system experiments, without making any preliminary assumption on the properties of $f$. The aim is reached by perturbatively solving the modified Einstein equations around a Schwarzschild background and retrieving a posteriori the corresponding $f(R)$. This turns out to be non analytical in $R=0$ and should be intended as the leading correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the low curvature limit. The parameters characterizing the $f(R)$ class are then set by constraining the corrections to four different local tests with the observations. The result is a class of $f(R)$ theories built up from a purely bottom-up approach and compatible with the local tests. At a more general level, this result can help constraining exact $f(R)$ models working in Cosmology, since it provides the correct local limit.

In this work, we pursue the study of the complexity=volume and complexity=action conjectures in a Schwarzschild-de Sitter geometry perturbed by the insertion of a shockwave at finite boundary times. This analysis extends previous studies that focused either on the complexity=volume 2.0 conjecture, or on the case of a shockwave inserted along the cosmological horizon. We show that the switchback effect, describing the delay in the evolution of complexity in reaction to a perturbation, is a universal feature of the complexity proposals in asymptotically de Sitter space.

Understanding how such a tensor product arises from the bulk perspective is an important open problem in holography, known as the factorisation puzzle. In this paper, we show how the Hilbert space of bulk states factorises due to non-perturbative contributions of spacetime wormholes: the trace over two-sided states with different particle excitations behind the horizon factorises into a product of traces of the left and right sides. This precisely occurs when such states form a complete basis for the bulk Hilbert space. We prove that the factorisation of the trace persists to all non-perturbative orders in $1/G_N$, consequently providing a possible resolution to the factorisation puzzle from the gravitational path integral. In the language of von Neumann algebras, our results provide strong evidence that the algebra of one-sided observables transitions from a Type II or Type III algebra, depending on whether or not perturbative gravity effects are included, to a Type I factor when including non-perturbative corrections in the bulk.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'black holes': 1, 'holography': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,"['Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"

Probing quantum complexity via universal saturation of stabilizer entropies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04190v1,"Tobias Haug, Leandro Aolita, M. S. Kim","Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer Rényi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on Rényi index $α$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $α$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $α>1$, while is a constant for $α<1$. This highlights that $α$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $α$: $α$-SREs with $α<1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $α>1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE.

On the zeros of partition functions with multi-spin interactions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04179v2,Alexander Barvinok,"Let $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ be probability spaces, let $X$ be their direct product, let $φ_1, \ldots, φ_m: X \longrightarrow {\Bbb C}$ be random variables, each depending only on a few coordinates of a point $x=(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$, and let $f=φ_1 + \ldots + φ_m$. The expectation $E\thinspace e^{λf}$, where $λ\in {\Bbb C}$, appears in statistical physics as the partition function of a system with multi-spin interactions, and also in combinatorics and computer science, where it is known as the partition function of edge-coloring models, tensor network contractions or a Holant polynomial. Assuming that each $φ_i$ is 1-Lipschitz in the Hamming metric of $X$, that each $φ_i(x)$ depends on at most $r \geq 2$ coordinates $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ of $x \in X$, and that for each $j$ there are at most $c \geq 1$ functions $φ_i$ that depend on the coordinate $x_j$, we prove that $E\thinspace e^{λf} \ne 0$ provided $| λ| \leq \ (3 c \sqrt{r-1})^{-1}$ and that the bound is sharp up to a constant factor.

An explanation for the absence of echoes in black hole light curve autocorrelations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04176v1,"Alejandro Cárdenas-Avendaño, Charles Gammie, Alexandru Lupsasca","The observed radiation from hot gas accreting onto a black hole depends on both the details of the flow and the spacetime geometry. The lensing behavior of a black hole produces a distinctive pattern of autocorrelations within its photon ring that encodes its mass, spin, and inclination. In particular, the time autocorrelation of the light curve is expected to display a series of peaks produced by light echoes of the source, with each peak delayed by the characteristic time lapse $τ$ between light echoes. However, such peaks are absent from the light curves of observed black holes. Here, we develop an analytical model for such light curves that demonstrates how, even though light echoes always exist in the signal, they do not produce autocorrelation peaks if the characteristic correlation timescale $λ_0$ of the source is greater than $τ$. We validate our model against simulated light curves of a stochastic accretion model ray traced with a general-relativistic code, and then fit the model to an observed light curve for Sgr A*. We infer that $λ_0>τ$, providing an explanation for the absence of light echoes in the time autocorrelations of Sgr A* light curves. Our results highlight the importance for black hole parameter inference of spatially resolving the photon ring via future space-based interferometry.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Towards bit threads in general gravitational spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04092v2,"Dong-Hui Du, Jia-Rui Sun","The concept of the generalized entanglement wedge was recently proposed by Bousso and Penington, which states that any bulk gravitational region $a$ possesses an associated generalized entanglement wedge $E(a) \supset a$ on a static Cauchy surface $M$ in general gravitational spacetimes, where $E(a)$ may contain an entanglement island $I(a)$. It suggests that the fine-grained entropy for bulk region $a$ is given by the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$. Motivated by this proposal, we extend the quantum bit thread description to general gravitational spacetimes, no longer limited to the AdS spacetime. By utilizing the convex optimization techniques, a dual flow description for the generalized entropy $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ of a bulk gravitational region $a$ is established on the static Cauchy surface $M$, such that $S_{\text{gen}}(E(a))$ is equal to the maximum flux of any flow that starts from the boundary $\partial M$ and ends at bulk region $a$, or equivalently, the maximum number of bit threads that connect the boundary $\partial M$ to the bulk region $a$. In addition, the nesting property of flows is also proved. Thus the basic properties of the entropy for bulk regions, i.e. the monotonicity, subadditivity, Araki-Lieb inequality and strong subadditivity, can be verified from flow perspectives by using properties of flows, such as the nesting property. Moreover, in max thread configurations, we find that there exists some lower bounds on the bulk entanglement entropy of matter fields in the region $E(a)\setminus a$, particularly on an entanglement island region $I(a) \subset (E(a)\setminus a)$, as required by the existence of a nontrivial generalized entanglement wedge.

Florentino, Shinya Kanemura, Masanori Tanaka","The nearly aligned Higgs Effective Field Theory (naHEFT) is based on the general assumption: all deviations in the Higgs boson couplings are originated from quantum one-loop effects of new particles that are integrated out. If the new particles integrated out have the same non-decoupling property, physics of the electroweak symmetry breaking can be then described by several parameters in the naHEFT, so that there is a correlation among the Higgs boson couplings such as $h γγ$, $hWW$ and $hhh$ couplings. In this paper, we analyze the strongly first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) with the condition of sphaleron decoupling and the completion condition of the phase transition, and investigate the relation among the deviations in the Higgs boson couplings and the dynamics of the EWPTs. We also take into account the gravitational wave spectrum as well as the primordial black hole predicted at the EWPT. We show that if the new particles integrated out include charged scalar states future precision measurements of the $h γγ$ coupling can give a useful prediction on the $hhh$ coupling to realize the strongly first-order EWPT.

This study presents a strategy to overcome this obstacle without changing the quantum circuit architecture. We propose incorporating auxiliary control qubits to shift the circuit from a unitary $2$-design to a unitary $1$-design, mitigating the prevalence of barren plateaus. We then remove these auxiliary qubits to return to the original circuit structure while preserving the unitary $1$-design properties. Our experiment suggests that the proposed structure effectively mitigates the barren plateaus phenomenon. A significant experimental finding is that the gradient of $θ_{1,1}$, the first parameter in the quantum circuit, displays a broader distribution as the number of qubits and layers increases. This suggests a higher probability of obtaining effective gradients. This stability is critical for the efficient training of quantum circuits, especially for larger and more complex systems.

E. Pringle","Accretion discs are fundamental to much of astronomy. They can occur around stars both young and old, around compact objects they provide a window into the extremes of physics, and around supermassive black holes in galaxy centres they generate spectacular luminosities that can outshine the entire galaxy. However, our understanding of the inner workings of accretion discs remains far from complete. Here we revisit a conundrum in the observations of some of the simplest accreting systems; the Cataclysmic Variables (CVs). The high-accretion-rate states of (non-magnetic) CVs can be divided into the short-lived outbursts ($\sim$ a week) typical of dwarf novae (DNe) and the long-lived (and sometimes perpetual) high states of nova-like (NL) CVs. Since both sorts of high-state occur in approximately steady-state accretion discs with similar properties and accretors, we would expect them to display similar spectral energy distributions. However, previous analyses based on UV spectra from the {\it International Ultraviolet Explorer} have shown that their spectral energy distributions are different. We perform a re-analysis of the data using up to date calibrations and distance (and thus dereddening) estimates to test whether this difference persists and whether it is statistically significant over the sample. We find that it does persist and it is statistically significant. We propose routes to investigating this discrepancy further and discuss the implications this has for other accreting systems, such as X-ray binaries, Active Galactic Nuclei and protoplanetary discs.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

However, the luminosity and formation rate are degenerated when directly fitting the redshift distribution of FRBs. In contrast to previous forward-fitting methods, we use the Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ method to derive luminosity function and formation rate of FRBs without any assumptions. Using the non-repeating FRBs from the first CHIME/FRB catalog, we find a relatively strong luminosity evolution, and luminosity function can be fitted by a broken power-law model with a break at $1.33\times10^{41}\ \mathrm{erg}\ \mathrm{s}^{-1}$. The formation rate declines rapidly as $(1+z)^{-4.9\pm0.3}$ with a local rate $1.13\times10^4\ \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\ \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. This monotonic decrease is similar to the rate of short gamma-ray bursts. After comparing it with star formation rate and stellar mass density, we conclude that the old populations including neutron stars and black holes, are closely related to the origins of FRBs.

In bipartite anyonic systems, pure states may have different marginal spectra, and mixed states may contain pure marginal states. More striking is that in a pure entangled state, parties may lack equal access to entanglement. This entanglement asymmetry is manifested in quantum teleportation employing an entangled anyonic state shared between Alice and Bob, where Alice can perfectly teleport unknown quantum information to Bob, but Bob lacks this capability.

The considered lattices are characterized by a Dirac like density of states, Schläfli indices $\{p,q\}=\{10,3\}$ and $\{8,3\}$, as well as by flat bands, $\{8,8\}$. The Dirac density of states cuts off the logarithmic divergence of the staggered spin susceptibility and allows for a finite $U$ semi-metal to insulator transition. This transition has the same mean-field exponents as for the Euclidean counterpart. In the presence of flat bands we observe the onset of magnetic ordering at any finite $U$. The magnetic state at intermediate coupling can be described as a global antiferromagnet. It breaks the $C_p$ rotational and time reversal symmetries but remains invariant under combined $C_p \mathcal{T}$ transformations. The state is characterized by macroscopic ferromagnetic moments, that globally cancel.

Finally, we provide formulae in terms of these operators for unitary evolution under conventional two- and four-body Hamiltonian terms, as well as terms varying the particle number. In this formalism, the number of qubits needed to codify $n$ particles with $N_p$ modes each is of order $n\log_2 N_p$. Such scaling is more efficient than the Jordan-Wigner transformation which requires $O(N_p)$ qubits, whenever there are a modest number of particles with a large number of states available to each (and less advantageous for a large number of particles with few states available to each). And although less efficient, it is also less cumbersome than compact encoding.",{'quantum computer': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Primordial black holes: the asteroid mass window,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03114v1,Peter Tinyakov,"Primordial black holes (PBHs) are an attractive dark matter candidate, particularly if they can explain the totality of it. At PBH masses below $\sim 10^{17}$g and above $\sim 10^{23}$g this possibility is excluded from the variety of arguments and with different confidence. The range in between, often referred to as the ""asteroid mass window"", currently remains unconstrained. The most promising, in our view, way to probe this mass range is to use stars as the PBH detectors. If a star captures even a single PBH it starts being accreted onto it and eventually gets destroyed -- converted into a sub-solar mass black hole. This process may have a variety of signatures form a mere star disappearance to supernova-type explosions of a new kind. The viability of this approach depends crucially on the probability of PBH capture by stars. In this chapter we summarize the existing capture mechanisms and discuss their implications for constraining the abundance of (or perhaps discovering) PBHs in the asteroid mass window.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Holographic image features of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03083v1,"Xiao-Xiong Zeng, Xin-Yun Hu, Ke-Jian He","By utilizing the AdS/CFT correspondence, we investigate the holographic image of an AdS black hole in Einstein-power-Yang-Mills gravity. The AdS boundary hosts a Gaussian oscillation source, which induces a lensed response on the opposite side of the boundary during propagation through bulk spacetime. The optical system assists observers at the north pole to continuously capture holographic images that show an axisymmetric bright ring known as the Einstein ring. As the observation position shifted, the bright ring gradually transformed into a luminous arc and eventually transitioned into a light point. Simultaneously, we examine the impact of variations in relevant physical quantity on the ring, and present the corresponding brightness curve. The results indicate that as the temperature $T$ and nonlinear Yang Mills charge parameter $q$ increase, the ring radius also increases, while an increase in the chemical potential $u$ leads to a decrease. However, the peak brightness curve of the ring invariably decreases as the values of $T$, $u$, and $q$ increase, albeit to varying degrees. Upon comparing the outcomes of geometric optics, it can be observed that the position of the ring in holography images is consistent with that of the photon sphere.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'holography': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Holography']
A Quantum Neural Network-Based Approach to Power Quality Disturbances Detection and Recognition,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.03081v1,"Guo-Dong Li, Hai-Yan He, Yue Li, Xin-Hao Li, Hao Liu, Qing-Le Wang, Long Cheng","Power quality disturbances (PQDs) significantly impact the stability and reliability of power systems, necessitating accurate and efficient detection and recognition methods. While numerous classical algorithms for PQDs detection and recognition have been extensively studied and applied, related work in the quantum domain is still in its infancy. In this paper, an improved quantum neural networks (QNN) model for PQDs detection and recognition is proposed. Specifically, the model constructs a quantum circuit comprising data qubits and ancilla qubits. Classical data is transformed into quantum data by embedding it into data qubits via the encoding layer. Subsequently, parametric quantum gates are utilized to form the variational layer, which facilitates qubit information transformation, thereby extracting essential feature information for detection and recognition. The expected value is obtained by measuring ancilla qubits, enabling the completion of disturbance classification based on this expected value. An analysis reveals that the runtime and space complexities of the QNN are $O\left ( poly\left ( N \right ) \right )$ and $O\left ( N \right )$, respectively. Extensive experiments validate the feasibility and superiority of the proposed model in PQD detection and recognition. The model achieves accuracies of 99.75\%, 97.85\% and 95.5\% in experiments involving the detection of disturbances, recognition of seven single disturbances, and recognition of ten mixed disturbances, respectively. Additionally, noise simulation and comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits robust anti-noise capabilities, requires few training parameters, and maintains high accuracy.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In this work, we consider what happens if such a dark matter candidate field mimicking a dark photon interacts with an accretion flow onto the black hole. By including a kinetic mixing term with the standard model photon, we extend the commonly used equations of general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics to a dark photon constituent. The coupling to the dark photon then appears as an effective dynamo term together with a dark Lorentz force acting on the accreting matter. We numerically study the interactions between the superradiant dark photon cloud and the inner accretion flow by solving the coupled system in full numerical relativity. By parameterically varying the mixing parameter between dark and standard model sector, we provide a first investigation of how the accretion flow could be modified. Depending on the coupling strength, our solutions exhibit increased wind launching, as well as oscillation modes in the disk.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Our analysis focuses on a solvable class of backgrounds that includes AdS and linear dilaton spacetimes as particular cases, with some results extended to general warped metrics. A general lesson is that the behavior of the holographic theory is tied to the bulk curvature singularities. We find that a singular background is confining if and only if i) the singularity coincides with a boundary or ii) it is the linear dilaton. In the former case, for which the singularity cuts off spacetime, we demonstrate that both entanglement entropy and thermodynamics exhibit a first order phase transition. In the linear dilaton case we find instead that both entanglement entropy and thermal phase transitions are of second order.

General-Relativistic Gauge-Invariant Magnetic Helicity Transport: Basic Formulation and Application to Neutron Star Mergers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02837v1,"Jiaxi Wu, Elias R. Most","Dynamo processes are ubiquitous in astrophysical systems. In relativistic astrophysical systems, such as accretion disks around black holes or neutron stars, they may critically affect the launching of winds and jets that can power electromagnetic emission. Dynamo processes are governed by several microscopic parameters, one of them being magnetic helicity. As a conserved quantity in nonresistive plasmas, magnetic helicity is transported across the system. One important implication of helicity conservation is, that in the absence of helicity fluxes some mean-field dynamos can be quenched, potentially affecting the large-scale evolution of the magnetic field. One of the major challenges in computing magnetic helicity is the need to fix a meaningful electromagnetic gauge. We here present a fully covariant formulation of magnetic helicity transport in general-relativistic plasmas based on the concept of relative helicity by Berger & Field and Finn & Antonsen. This formulation is separately invariant under gauge-transformation of the Maxwell and Einstein equations. As an application of this new formalism we present the first analysis of magnetic helicity transport in the merger of two neutron stars. We demonstrate the presence of global helicity fluxes into the outer layers of the stellar merger remnant, which may impact subsequent large-scale dynamo amplification in these regions.","{'black holes': 1, 'einstein equations': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

However, given the impossibility of directly observing black holes, there is no clear choice for a prior. We present a framework for flexibly designing a range of priors, each bringing different biases to the image reconstruction. These priors can be weak (e.g., impose only basic natural-image statistics) or strong (e.g., impose assumptions of black-hole structure). Our framework uses Bayesian inference with score-based priors, which are data-driven priors arising from a deep generative model that can learn complicated image distributions. Using our Bayesian imaging approach with sophisticated data-driven priors, we can assess how visual features and uncertainty of reconstructed images change depending on the prior. In addition to simulated data, we image the real EHT M87* data and discuss how recovered features are influenced by the choice of prior.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
KPZ scaling from the Krylov space,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02782v1,"Alexander Gorsky, Sergei Nechaev, Alexander Valov","Recently, a superdiffusion exhibiting the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) scaling in late-time correlators and autocorrelators of certain interacting many-body systems has been reported. Inspired by these results, we explore the KPZ scaling in correlation functions using their realization in the Krylov operator basis. We focus on the Heisenberg time scale, which approximately corresponds to the ramp--plateau transition for the Krylov complexity in systems with a large but finite number degrees of freedom. Two frameworks are under consideration: i) the system with growing Lanczos coefficients and an artificial cut-off, and ii) the system with the finite Hilbert space. In both cases via numerical analysis, we observe the transition from Gaussian to KPZ-like scaling at the critical Euclidean time $t_{E}^*=c_{cr}K$, for the Krylov chain of finite length $K$, and $c_{cr}=O(1)$. In particular, we find a scaling $\sim K^{1/3}$ for fluctuations in the one-point correlation function and a dynamical scaling $\sim K^{-2/3}$ associated with the return probability (Loschmidt echo) corresponding to autocorrelators in physical space. In the first case, the transition is of the 3rd order and can be considered as an example of dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT), while in the second, it is a crossover. For case ii), utilizing the relationship between the spectrum of tridiagonal matrices at the spectral edge and the spectrum of the stochastic Airy operator, we demonstrate analytically the origin of the KPZ scaling for the particular Krylov chain using the results of the probability theory. We argue that there is some outcome of our study for the double scaling limit of matrix models. For the case of topological gravity, the white noise $O(\frac{1}{N})$ term is identified, which should be taken into account in the controversial issue of ensemble averaging in 2D/1D holography.",{'holography': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Holography']
No Significant Redshift Evolution in the Intrinsic Scatter of the $M_\bullet$-$M_\star$ Relation for Overmassive Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02779v1,"Carl Audric Guia, Fabio Pacucci","In the local Universe, the ratio between the mass of a central black hole and the stellar mass of its host galaxy is $\sim 0.1 \%$. Recently, JWST discovered numerous galaxies at $z>4$ that seem to deviate from the local relation, with black holes overmassive by $10-100$ times. Similar galaxies were also discovered at cosmic noon. The intrinsic scatter in the relation describes how much the evolutionary histories of the single galaxies deviate from the mean evolutionary pattern of their parent dataset. This Research Note examines whether a cosmic evolution of the intrinsic scatter can be detected by assessing its value for datasets in various redshift ranges. Using data from the local Universe ($z < 0.055$), low ($ 0.4 \leq z \leq 0.9$), intermediate ($ 0.9 \leq z \leq 4$), and high ($z > 4$) redshift, we conclude that there is no statistically significant redshift evolution of the intrinsic scatter.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

On the role of closed timelike curves and confinement structure around Kerr-Newman singularity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02697v1,"Ayanendu Dutta, Dhritimalya Roy, Subenoy Chakraborty","In this study, the particle motion around the naked singularity and black hole of Kerr-Newman spacetime is investigated with a special attention on the closed timelike orbits. It is found that both in the naked singularity (NS) and in black hole (BH), the singularity is concealed by causality violating regions, and the Cauchy surface consistently resides inside the inner horizon in non-extremal black holes. For neutral particles and particles with an identical charge to the source, only particles with positive angular momentum are permitted to traverse the closed timelike curves. Conversely, for particles with the opposite charge to the source, the strong Coulomb attraction draws all particles inside the Cauchy surface, allowing them to be present in the closed timelike curves irrespective of their angular momentum. However, in both the NS and BH (both extremal and non-extremal), test particles are confined at a considerable distance from the singular point such that there always exists an empty region surrounding the singularity which prevents particles from interacting with it. The radius of the empty surface that depends on the source parameters and the particle characteristics, is investigated with an accurate expression.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Pasham","In the past five years, six quasi-periodic X-ray eruption (QPE) sources have been discovered in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. Their origin remains an open question. We present MUSE integral field spectroscopy of five QPE host galaxies to characterize their properties. We find that 3/5 galaxies host extended emission line regions (EELRs) up to 10 kpc in size. The EELRs are photo-ionized by a non-stellar continuum, but the current nuclear luminosity is insufficient to power the observed emission lines. The EELRs are decoupled from the stars both kinematically and in projected sky position, and the low velocities and velocity dispersions ($<$ 100 km s$^{-1}$ and $\lesssim 75$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively) are inconsistent with being AGN- or shock-driven. The origin of the EELRs is likely a previous phase of nuclear activity. The QPE host galaxy properties are strikingly similar to those of tidal disruption events (Wevers et al. submitted). The preference for a very short-lived (the typical EELR lifetime is $\sim$15000 years), gas-rich phase where the nucleus has recently faded significantly suggests that TDEs and QPEs may share a common formation channel, disfavoring AGN accretion disk instabilities as the origin of QPEs. In the assumption that QPEs are related to extreme mass ratio inspiral systems (EMRIs; stellar-mass objects on bound orbits about massive black holes), the high incidence of EELRs and recently faded nuclear activity can be used to aid in the localization of the host galaxies of EMRIs discovered by low frequency gravitational wave observatories.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Bondi Flow from Various Perspectives,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02673v1,"Souvik Ghose, Tapas K. Das","Realization of the stationary integral solutions of steady state transonic accretion flow in spherical symmetry helps to understand accretion phenomena on various astrophysical objects. In recent years, attempts have been made to study accreting black hole systems as an example of autonomous dynamical systems. The fixed point analysis is used to study the transonic properties of accretion flow onto an astrophysical black hole, hence the nature of the phase orbits for the transonic flow solutions can be understood without constructing the integral solutions. Since a large-scale astrophysical fluid flow is vulnerable to external perturbation, one needs to ensure that the stationary accretion solutions are stable under perturbation. By adopting a time-dependent stability analysis scheme for the accretion flow, one demonstrates under which condition the perturbation will not diverge. It has also been observed that a space-time metric, dubbed the sonic metric, can be constructed to describe the propagation of the perturbation embedded within the accreting fluid, which mimics a black hole like spacetime within the accreting fluid, where the transonic surfaces can be identified with a black hole like horizons. Such identification is accomplished using the theory of causal structure - by constructing Carter-Penrose diagrams. An accreting black hole system, thus, can be perceived as a classical analogue gravity model naturally found in the universe. Hence, accretion phenomena onto astrophysical black holes can be looked upon from three apparently non-overlapping perspectives - astrophysical processes, theory of dynamical systems, and emergent gravity (alternatively, the analogue gravity) phenomena, respectively. The present article illustrates, by taking the simplest possible accretion flow model, how one can study astrophysical accretion processes from the aforementioned perspectives (Abridged).",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Using the cosmological simulations IllustrisTNG and ASTRID, we identify analogous galaxies and investigate their abundance, formation, quenching mechanisms, and post-quenching evolution for stellar masses $9.5 < \log_{10}{(M_\star/{\rm M}_\odot)} < 12$. We apply three different quenching definitions and find that both simulations significantly underestimate the comoving number density of quenched massive galaxies at $z \gtrsim 3$ compared to JWST observations by up to $\sim 2$ dex. This fact highlights the necessity for improved physical models of AGN feedback in galaxy formation simulations. In both simulations, the high-$z$ quenched massive galaxies often host overmassive central black holes above the standard $M_{BH}-M_\star$ relation, implying that the AGN feedback plays a crucial role in quenching galaxies in the early Universe. The typical quenching timescales for these galaxies are $\sim 200-600$ Myr. IllustrisTNG primarily employs AGN kinetic feedback, while ASTRID relies on AGN thermal feedback, which is less effective and has a longer quenching timescale.

In trapped-ion devices, this connectivity can be provided by physically moving subregisters consisting of a few ions across the processor. The topology of the connectivity is given by the layout of the ion trap where one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrangements are possible. Here, we focus on an architecture based on a rectangular two-dimensional lattice, where each lattice site contains a subregister with a linear string of ions. We refer to this architecture as the Quantum Spring Array (QSA). Subregisters placed in neighboring lattice sites can be coupled by bringing the respective ion strings close to each other while avoiding merging them into a single trapping potential. Control of the separation of subregisters along one axis of the lattice, known as the axial direction, uses quasi-static voltages, while the second axis, the radial, requires control of radio frequency signals. In this work, we investigate key elements of the 2D lattice quantum computation architecture along both axes: We show that the coupling rate between neighboring lattice sites increases with the number of ions per site and the motion of the coupled system can be resilient to noise. The coherence of the coupling is assessed, and an entangled state of qubits in separate trapping regions along the radial axis is demonstrated. Moreover, we demonstrate control over radio frequency signals to adjust radial separation between strings, and thus tune their coupling rate.

In both cases, we demonstrate the existence of a nontrivial algebra of diffeomorphism-invariant observables \emph{without} the introduction of an external clock system or the presence of any asymptotic gravitational charges. Instead, the rolling inflaton field and the evaporating black hole act as physical clocks that allow a definition of gauge-invariant observables at $G = 0$. The resulting algebras are both Type II$_\infty$ factors, but neither is manifestly a crossed product algebra.

We also briefly discuss the construction of gauge-invariant algebras for compact wedges bounded by extremal surfaces in generic spacetimes (i.e. in the absence of any Killing symmetry). In contrast to the inflaton and black hole cases, this algebra does end up being a simple crossed product. No clock or asymptotic charges are required because of the absence of any symmetry in the classical background.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Dividing quantum circuits for time evolution of stochastic processes by orthogonal series density estimation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01889v1,Koichi Miyamoto,"Quantum Monte Carlo integration (QMCI) is a quantum algorithm to estimate expectations of random variables, with applications in various industrial fields such as financial derivative pricing. When QMCI is applied to expectations concerning a stochastic process $X(t)$, e.g., an underlying asset price in derivative pricing, the quantum circuit $U_{X(t)}$ to generate the quantum state encoding the probability density of $X(t)$ can have a large depth. With time discretized into $N$ points, using state preparation oracles for the transition probabilities of $X(t)$, the state preparation for $X(t)$ results in a depth of $O(N)$, which may be problematic for large $N$. Moreover, if we estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ at $N$ time points, the total query complexity scales on $N$ as $O(N^2)$, which is worse than the $O(N)$ complexity in the classical Monte Carlo method. In this paper, to improve this, we propose a method to divide $U_{X(t)}$ based on orthogonal series density estimation. This approach involves approximating the densities of $X(t)$ at $N$ time points with orthogonal series, where the coefficients are estimated as expectations of the orthogonal functions by QMCI. By using these approximated densities, we can estimate expectations concerning $X(t)$ by QMCI without requiring deep circuits. Our error and complexity analysis shows that to obtain the approximated densities at $N$ time points, our method achieves the circuit depth and total query complexity scaling as $O(\sqrt{N})$ and $O(N^{3/2})$, respectively.",{'quantum circuit': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We unveil simple matrix model representations for these correlators which we can sometimes solve analytically. For general huge operators, we translate these matrix model expressions into a $1+1$ dimensional hydrodynamical fluid problem. This fluid is integrable thus unveiling a novel integrable sector of the $AdS/CFT$ duality in a full fledged gravitational regime, very far from the usual free string planar regime where integrability reigns supreme. We explain how an adiabatic deformation method can be developed to yield the solution to an integrable discrete formulation of these fluids -- the rational Calogero-Moser Model -- so we can access the general three point correlation functions of generic huge $1/2$-BPS operators.

Gravitational Wave Driven Inspirals of Non-relativistic Binaries Connected by Cosmic Strings,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01758v1,"Ahmed Sheta, Yuri Levin","We consider gravitational waves from a pair of non-relativistically moving monopoles or black holes connected by a cosmic string. Shortly after the binary's formation, the connecting string straightens due the direct coupling of its motion to gravitational radiation. Afterwards, the motion of the binary can be well-approximated by a non-relativistic motion of its components that have an additional constant mutual attraction force due to the tension of the straight string that connects them. The orbit shrinks due to the gravitational radiation backreacting on the binary's components. We find that if the binary's semimajor axis $a\gg \sqrt{R_1 R_2/μ}$, its eccentricity grows on the inspiral's timescale; here $R_1$ and $R_2$ are the gravitational radii of the binary components, and $μ$ is the dimensionless tension of the string. When the eccentricity is high, it approaches unity super-exponentially. If the binary's components are monopole-antimonopole pair, this leads to the physical collision that would likely destroy the string and annihilate the monopoles when the semimajor axis is still many orders of magnitude greater than the string thickness. If the binary's components are black holes, then the eccentricity reaches its peak when $a\sim \sqrt{R_1 R_2/μ}$, and then decays according to the standard Peter's formula. The black-hole spins initially become locked to the orbital motion, but then lag behind as the inspiral proceeds. We estimate the string-tension-induced dimensionless spins just prior to the merger and find them to be $\simμ^{3/8}\ll 1$.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

We provide an overview of the internal workflow, describing the integration of a customized ansatz and variational parameter update strategy, efficient error suppression in hardware execution, and overhead-free post-processing to correct for bit-flip errors. We benchmark this solver on IBM quantum computers for several classically nontrivial unconstrained binary optimization problems -- the entire optimization is conducted on hardware with no use of classical simulation or prior knowledge of the solution. First, we demonstrate the ability to correctly solve Max-Cut instances for random regular graphs with a variety of densities using up to 120 qubits, where the graph topologies are not matched to device connectivity. Next, we apply the solver to higher-order binary optimization and successfully search for the ground state energy of a 127-qubit spin-glass model with linear, quadratic, and cubic interaction terms. Use of this new quantum solver increases the likelihood of finding the minimum energy by up to $\sim1,500\times$ relative to published results using a DWave annealer, and it can find the correct solution when the annealer fails. Furthermore, for both problem types, the Q-CTRL solver outperforms a heuristic local solver used to indicate the relative difficulty of the problems pursued.

X-ray bright AGN in local dwarf galaxies: insights from eROSITA,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01707v1,"Andrea Sacchi, Akos Bogdan, Urmila Chadayammuri, Angelo Ricarte","Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies also commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain a memory of the assembly history of their black holes, probing the black hole occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first black holes. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering $20,000~\rm{deg^2}$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D<200$~Mpc) dwarf galaxies. After cleaning our sample from cosmic X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining ${\rm d}N/{\rm d}L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the centroid of dwarf galaxies and the X-ray sources, we find that about $50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We also compare the black hole-to-stellar mass relation of the AGN in our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former. This suggests that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample is too shallow to distinguish between different seeding models, it favors a growth mechanism linked to the star-formation rate of the host galaxy.",{'black holes': 3},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Bit by Bit: Gravity Through the Lens of Quantum Information,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01695v1,William Munizzi,"This dissertation reviews several recent advances at the intersection of quantum information and holography. In holography, properties of quantum systems admit a gravitational interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. For holographic states, boundary entanglement entropy is dual to bulk geodesic areas, known as Ryu-Takayanagi surfaces. Furthermore, the viability to possess a holographic dual at all is constrained by entanglement structure. Accordingly, entanglement enables a coarse classification of states in a Hilbert space. Similarly, state transformation under operator groups also provides a classification on the Hilbert space. Stabilizer states, for example, are invariant under large sets of operations and consequently can be simulated on a classical computer. Cayley graphs offer a useful representation for a group of operators, where vertices represent group elements and edges represent generators. The orbit of a state under action of the group can also be represented as a ""reachability graph"", a quotient of the group Cayley graph. Reachability graphs can be dressed to encode entanglement information, making them a useful tool for studying entanglement dynamics. Quotienting a reachability graph by group elements that fix a state computable, e.g. entanglement entropy, builds a ""contracted graph"". Contracted graphs explicitly bound state parameter evolution in quantum circuits. In this thesis, an upper bound on entanglement entropy evolution in Clifford circuits is presented. Another important property of quantum systems is magic, which quantifies the difficulty of simulating a quantum state. Magic and entanglement play complementary roles when describing emergent phenomena in AdS/CFT. This work describes the interplay of entanglement and magic, offering holographic consequences for magic as cosmic brane back-reaction.","{'AdS/CFT': 2, 'holography': 2}",06.2024,2024,06,['Holography']

However, the spectrum is extremely sensitive to small deformations of the system and describes the linear response only in a certain (not precisely defined) timeframe after the merger. We argue here that the greybody factors, recently shown to describe the ringdown spectral amplitude at relatively high frequencies, are instead stable under small perturbations of the system and free of certain ambiguities that plague the quasinormal mode spectrum. Our analysis also unveils a nontrivial interplay: while certain ringdown quantities are dominated by the contribution of spectrally unstable quasinormal modes, these modes conspire to produce stable observables. Thus, we propose a complementary approach to ringdown studies, which circumvents some limitations of the standard quasinormal mode description.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

We study the detectability of IMBH binary mergers and the measurability of their parameters with next-generation ground-based detector networks consisting of various combinations of Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET) interferometers. We find that, for binaries with component masses $m_{1,2}\sim 1000\,M_\odot$, an optimal 3-detector network can constrain the masses with errors $\lesssim 0.1\%$ ($\lesssim 1\%$) at $z=0.5$ ($z=2$), and the source redshift can be measured with percent-level accuracy or better at $z\lesssim 2$. The redshift of lighter binaries ($m_{1,2}\lesssim 300\,M_\odot$) can still be measured with $O(10)\%$ accuracy even at $z=10$. Binaries with $z\lesssim 0.5$ can be localized within $1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for $m_{1,2}\lesssim 1000\,M_\odot$, and within $0.1\,\rm{deg}^2$ for comparable mass systems. The sky localization is good enough that it may be possible to cross-correlate GW searches with galaxy catalogs and to search for electromagnetic counterparts to IMBH mergers.

The spin magnitude of stellar-mass binary black holes evolves with the mass: evidence from gravitational wave data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01679v1,"Grégoire Pierra, Simone Mastrogiovanni, Stéphane Perriès","The relation between the mass and spin of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) has been proposed to be a smoking gun for the presence of multiple formation channels for compact objects. First-generation black holes (BHs) formed by isolated binary stellar progenitors are expected to have nearly aligned small spins, while nth-generation BBHs resulting from hierarchical mergers are expected to have misaligned and higher spins. Leveraging data from the third observing run O3 (GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3), we employ hierarchical Bayesian methods to conduct a comprehensive study of possible correlations between the BBH masses and spins. We use parametric models that either superpose independent BBH populations or explicitly model a mass-spin correlation. We unveil strong evidence for a correlation between normalized spin magnitudes and masses of BBHs. The correlation can be explained as a transition from a BBH population with low spins at low masses and higher spins for higher masses. Although the spin magnitude distribution at high masses lacks robust constraints, we find strong evidence that a transition between two BBH populations with different spin distributions should happen at 40-50 $M_{\odot}$. In particular, we find that the population of BBHs above 40-50 $M_{\odot}$ should compose the $\sim 2 \%$ of the overall population, with a spin magnitude $χ$ peaking around 0.7, consistently with the fraction of nth-generation BBHs formed by hierarchical mergers in the latest state-of-the-art BBH genesis simulations.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Repeating Partial Tidal Encounters of Sun-like Stars Leading to their Complete Disruption,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01670v1,"Chang Liu, Ricardo Yarza, Enrico Ramirez-Ruiz","Stars grazing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) on bound orbits may produce periodic flares over many passages, known as repeating partial tidal disruption events (TDEs). Here we present 3D hydrodynamic simulations of sun-like stars over multiple tidal encounters. The star is significantly restructured and becomes less concentrated as a result of mass loss and tidal heating. The vulnerability to mass loss depends sensitively on the stellar density structure, and the strong correlation between the fractional mass loss $ΔM/M_*$ and the ratio of the central and average density $ρ_{\mathrm{c}}/\barρ$, which was initially derived in disruption simulations of main-sequence stars, also applies for stars strongly reshaped by tides. Over multiple orbits, the star loses progressively more mass in each encounter and is doomed to a complete disruption. Throughout its lifetime, the star may produce numerous weak flares (depending on the initial impact parameter), followed by a couple of luminous flares whose brightness increases exponentially. Flux-limited surveys are heavily biased towards the brightest flares, which may appear similar to the flare produced by the same star undergoing a full disruption on its first tidal encounter. This places new challenges on constraining the intrinsic TDE rates, which needs to take repeating TDEs into account. Other types of stars with different initial density structure (e.g., evolved stars with massive cores) follow distinct evolution tracks, which might explain the diversity of the long-term luminosity evolution seen in recently uncovered repeaters.",{'black holes': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

The theory admits fuzzy sphere as static solution. Over the fuzzy geometry, the quantum mechanics of the fermions is given by a sum of oscillators with equal frequency. The energy state where exactly half of the Fermi sea is filled contains the maximal amount of degeneracy. This state of the fuzzy sphere obeys the mass-radius relation of a Schwarzschild black hole if the fuzzy sphere is identified with the black hole horizon. Moreover the set of states in the Fermi sea gives precisely the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. We thus propose that quantum black holes are described by fuzzy spheres with a half-filled Fermi sea in our theory. We also consider a system of two fuzzy spheres by embedding them as blocks in the matrix quantum mechanics. When the distance $r$ between the two fuzzy spheres is small, the total energy of the system can be computed using perturbation theory. We show that in the leading order of large $N$ limit, the interaction energy depends on the product of the black holes masses and the Newton constant exactly as in Newton gravity. To extract the correct $r$ dependence in the long range, a resummation of all the large $N$ corrections is needed. We outline how Newton gravity for static sources may be reproduced in the long distance limit. We also show that the interaction energy is generally finite in the short distance limit, suggesting that the black hole singularity in general relativity is removed in our quantum description of black hole.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

However, superconducting circuits have so far received only limited attention in this regard. Moreover, for quantum superpositions of spacetime geometries - a highly contentious notion within the quantum gravity community itself - there currently exist no solid state blueprints. We here show how quantum circuit hardware can implement a variety of classical and quantum spacetime geometries on lattices, by both using established circuit elements and introducing new ones. We demonstrate the possibility of a metric sharply changing within a single lattice point, thus entering a regime where the spacetime curvature itself is trans-Planckian, and the Hawking temperature ill-defined. In fact, our approach suggests that stable, thermal event horizons are incompatible with strictly discrete lattice models. We thus propose to directly probe the evaporation of a wormhole by tracking the accumulation of charge and phase quantum fluctuations over short time scales, which are a robust signature even in the presence of a dissipative environment. Moreover, we present a loop-hole for the typical black/while hole ambiguity in lattice simulations: the existence of exceptional points in the dispersion relation allows for the creation of pure black (or white) hole horizons - at the expense of radically changing the interior wormhole dynamics. Finally, based on multistable Josephson junctions, we introduce the notion of quantum inductors: circuit elements that can be prepared in a superposition of different inductance values.

By considering the pair magnetization $σ_{\rm e}$ in the upstream region and the mass accretion rate $\dot{m}$ (in units of the Eddington mass accretion rate) as free parameters we estimate the strength of the magnetic field and develop analytical models, motivated by recent three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations, to describe the populations of relativistic electron and positrons (pairs) in the reconnection region. Applying our model to M87*, we numerically compute the non-thermal photon spectra for various values of $σ_e$. We show that pairs that are accelerated up to the synchrotron radiation-limited energy while meandering across both sides of the current sheet, can produce MeV flares with luminosity of $\sim 10^{41}$~erg s$^{-1}$ -- independent of $σ_e$ -- for a black hole accreting at $\dot{m}=10^{-5}$. Pairs that are trapped in the transient current sheet can produce X-ray counterparts to the MeV flares, lasting about a day for current sheets with length of a few gravitational radii. We also show that the upstream plasma can be enriched due to photon-photon pair creation, and derive a new equilibrium magnetization of $σ_e \sim 10^3-10^4$ for $\dot{m}=10^{-6} - 10^{-5}$. Additionally, we explore the potential of magnetospheric current sheets to accelerate protons to ultra-high energies, finding that while acceleration to such energies is limited by various loss mechanisms, such as synchrotron and photopion losses from the non-thermal emission from pairs, maximal proton energies in the range of a few EeV are attainable in magnetospheric sheets forming around supermassive sub-Eddington accreting black holes.",{'black holes': 2},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
A Study of Black Holes and Beyond: Shadows and Relativistic Orbits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01202v1,Parth Bambhaniya,"This doctoral thesis is organized into seven chapters. The first chapter introduces readers to the formation of black holes and naked singularities as an end state of continuous gravitational collapse. The physical and geometrical properties of the Schwarzschild black hole, JMN-1 naked singularity, and JNW naked singularity are summarised. The motivation and objectives to be derived are based on the literature reviews. The second chapter deals with the shadows of the mentioned compact objects. The equations of motion are explicitly calculated for general spherically symmetric and static spacetimes using the ray-tracing formalism and the null geodesics. The third chapter focuses on the construction of rotating naked singularity using the NJA. The NJA is used without complexification method and obtain rotating JNW naked singularity spacetime. The general formalism of the shadow shape is derived for rotating spacetime and obtain the shadow shapes for the rotating JNW, Kerr and deformed Kerr spacetimes. In the fourth chapter, the precession of timelike-bound orbits is investigated in the Schwarzschild, JMN-1, and JNW spacetimes. The fully relativistic orbit equations are derived for the provided models. The approximate solutions of the orbit equations are used to characterize the nature of orbital precession. The next chapter is on the precession of timelike bound orbits in the rotating Kerr and JNW spacetimes. The sixth chapter deals with the relativistic orbits of S-stars and discusses the orbital parameters of the real and apparent orbits. Astrometric data of the S2 star has been adopted from the available literature and use numerical techniques to study the relativistic orbits of the S2 star in the presence of a scalar field. The final chapter aims at summarising the results followed by some futuristic scopes that probe the nature of Sgr A* with a possible black hole mimicker.","{'black holes': 1, 'geodesics': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum consistent neural/tensor networks for photonic circuits with strongly/weakly entangled states,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.01157v1,Nicolas Allegra,"Modern quantum optical systems such as photonic quantum computers and quantum imaging devices require great precision in their designs and implementations in the hope to realistically exploit entanglement and reach a real quantum advantage. The theoretical and experimental explorations and validations of these systems are greatly dependent on the precision of our classical simulations. However, as Hilbert spaces increases, traditional computational methods used to design and optimize these systems encounter hard limitations due to the quantum curse of dimensionally. To address this challenge, we propose an approach based on neural and tensor networks to approximate the exact unitary evolution of closed entangled systems in a precise, efficient and quantum consistent manner.

Our methodology focuses on evolving quantum circuits with the aim of enhancing their capability to approximate functions relevant in various machine learning tasks. We introduce several mutation operators inspired by the transformation rules of ZX-calculus and investigate their impact on the learning efficiency and accuracy of quantum circuits. The empirical analysis involves a comparative study where these mutations are applied to a diverse set of quantum regression problems, measuring performance metrics such as the percentage of valid circuits after the mutation, improvement of the objective, as well as circuit depth and width. Our results indicate that certain ZX-calculus-based mutations perform significantly better than others for Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) in all metrics considered.

Cosmological constant as an integration constant,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00932v3,"Justin C.

In this article, we consider theories in which the CC is regarded as an integration constant. These theories include trace-free Einstein gravity, theories constructed from the Codazzi equation (which includes Cotton gravity and a gauge-gravity inspired theory), and conformal Killing gravity. We remark on a recent debate regarding the viability of Cotton gravity and find that while the Codazzi equation is indeed underdetermined, the solutions of the Codazzi equation trivialize to $λg_{ab}$ on generic backgrounds, and that in principle, one can close the system with the divergence-free condition and an appropriate choice of initial data. We also propose a full variational principle (full in the sense that variations in all variables are considered) for each of the aforementioned theories that can incorporate the matter sector; in this manner, we can obtain the trace-free Einstein equations without a unimodular constraint.",{'einstein equations': 1},06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

Fokker-Planck Equation and de Sitter Duality,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00886v2,Yoshihisa Kitazawa,Infra-Red scaling property of inflationary universe is in the same universality class of random walk. The two point correlators of the curvature perturbations are enhanced by the e-folding number N. The distribution function of the curvature perturbation $ρ_t (ζ)$ satisfies the Fokker Planck equation. The de Sitter universes are dual to the random walk: They belong to the Universality class of dimension two fractal. These boundary and bulk duality are at the heart of holography of quantum gravity. Historically the correspondence of thermodynamics and Einstein's equation are recognized as the first evidence for de Sitter duality .Our de Sitter duality relates the stochastic and geometric point of view. We study two types of the solutions of FP equation in quasi de Sitter space: (1) UV complete spacetime and (2) inflationary spacetime with concave potentials. The maximum entropy principle favors the following scenario: The universe is (a) born with small epsilon and (b) grows by inflation in the concave potential. We predict n_s <0.975(0.97) and r < 0.04(0.03) for N=50(60) at the pivot angle 0.002Mpc^{-1}. We have lowered the upper bound of $r$ by taking account of random walk effect at the boundary.

Reconnection not only converts energy during solar flares and geomagnetic substorms that drive space weather near Earth, but it may also play critical roles in the high energy emissions from the magnetospheres of neutron stars and black holes. In this review article, we focus on collisionless plasmas that are most relevant to reconnection in many space and astrophysical plasmas. Guided by first-principles kinetic simulations and spaceborne in-situ observations, we highlight the most recent progress in understanding this fundamental plasma process. We start by discussing the non-ideal electric field in the generalized Ohm's law that breaks the frozen-in flux condition in ideal magnetohydrodynamics and allows magnetic reconnection to occur. We point out that this same reconnection electric field also plays an important role in sustaining the current and pressure in the current sheet and then discuss the determination of its magnitude (i.e., the reconnection rate), based on force balance and energy conservation. This approach to determining the reconnection rate is applied to kinetic current sheets of a wide variety of magnetic geometries, parameters, and background conditions. We also briefly review the key diagnostics and modeling of energy conversion around the reconnection diffusion region, seeking insights from recently developed theories.

When applied to specific tasks, the parameters in the quantum circuits are trained to minimize the target function. Although there have been comprehensive studies to improve the performance of the PQCs on practical tasks, the errors caused by the quantum noise downgrade the performance when running on real quantum computers. In particular, when the quantum state is transformed through multiple quantum circuit layers, the effect of the quantum noise happens cumulatively and becomes closer to the maximally mixed state or complete noise. This paper studies the relationship between the quantum noise and the diffusion model. Then, we propose a novel diffusion-inspired learning approach to mitigate the quantum noise in the PQCs and reduce the error for specific tasks.

EL Balali","In this paper, we generate a rotating solution of the reduced Kiselev black hole through the Newman-Janis formalism. Based on such solution, we remark different shadow behaviors by varying the involved parameters $r_k, a, α$. Concretely, we observe that the allowed values of the spin parameter $a$ are much less than the usual rotating black holes. By deeply analysing the shadow shapes, we show that comparable shadow shapes emerge for the same ratio $a/r_k$. On the other hand, we recognize that the parameters $a$ and $α$ governs the shadow geometry while the parameter $r_k$ rules the size of such a quantity. Besides, we notice that an elliptic shadow geometry appears for certain range of relevant parameters. By making contact with the observational side, we provide a constraint on the rotating reduced Kiselev (RRK) black hole parameters. In particular, we find a good compatibility between the theoretical and experimental results. Regarding Hawking radiation, we note that the Kiselev radius $r_ k$ shows a similar behavior to the quintessence filed intensity $\mathbf{c}$. Concerning the light motion in the vicinity of a RRK black hole, we investigate deeply the deflection by varying the relevant parameters. In particular, we remark that such a quantity decreases by increasing the parameters $a$ and $α$ while the opposite effect is observed when increasing $r_k$.","{'black holes': 1, 'hawking radiation': 1}",06.2024,2024,06,['Black Holes and GR']

The distribution of DM particles in a UCMH follows a steeper density profile compared with classical DM halo. It is expected the DM annihilation rate is very large in UCMHs resulting in a contribution to, e.g., the extragalactic neutrino flux. In this work, we investigate the extragalactic neutrino flux from clothed PBHs due to DM annihilation, and then the muon flux for neutrino detection. Compared with the atmospheric neutrino flux, we derive the upper limits on the cosmological abundance of PBHs for 10 years exposure time of, e.g., the IceCube experiment. For the DM mass $m_χ=100~(1000)$ GeV, the upper limits (2$σ$) on the fraction of DM in PBHs are $f_{\rm PBH}=1.2\times 10^{-3}~(8.9\times 10^{-5})$ for contained events and $f_{\rm PBH}=2.5\times 10^{-3}~(1.3\times 10^{-5})$ for upward events, respectively.

Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole and its shadow in scalar-tensor-vector gravity theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00579v2,"Wentao Liu, Di Wu, Xiongjun Fang, Jiliang Jing, Jieci Wang","The scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG) theory has attracted significant interest due to its ability to effectively address the issue of galaxy rotation curves and clusters of galaxies without considering the influence of dark matter. In this paper, we construct rotating black hole solutions with a cosmological constant in the STVG theory (i.e., Kerr-MOG-(A)dS black hole solutions), where the import of a gravitational charge as a source modifies the gravitational constant, determined by $ G=G_{\text{N}}(1+α) $. For Kerr-MOG-dS spacetime, the observer is situated at a specific location within the domain of outer communication, rather than being located infinitely far away. Since black hole shadows are shaped by light propagation in spacetime, the interaction between the MOG parameter and the cosmological constant is expected to produce novel effects on these shadows. As the cosmological constant $Λ$ increases, the apparent size of the black hole shadow on the screen decreases. Additionally, the shadow expands with an increase in the MOG parameter $α$, reaching a maximum at a certain value, and its shape becomes more rounded under an arbitrary rotation parameter, which leads to degeneracy between different black hole parameters. However, by employing numerical backward ray-tracing techniques, we have found that gravitational lensing and the frame-dragging effect effectively distinguish this degeneracy.

At first, the perturbation waveform includes echoes and damping oscillations around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while it has only the damping waveform around Schwarzschild black holes. Secondly, the difference between adjacent peaks of echoes varies with the mass parameter and the defect parameter in the waveform around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, while it always keeps constant around Schwarzschild black holes. Thirdly, the ordinary isospectrality between the odd and even parities no longer exists in the quasi-normal modes of gravitational perturbations around Schwarzschild traversable wormholes, but an alternative isospectrality appears.

To address this problem, we implement and study a heuristic tomographic method that combines variational optimization on tensor networks with randomized measurement techniques. Using this approach, we demonstrate its ability to learn the ground state of the surface code Hamiltonian as well as an experimentally realizable quantum spin liquid state.

Fast inspirals and the treatment of orbital resonances,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.21072v1,"Philip Lynch, Vojtěch Witzany, Maarten van de Meent, Niels Warburton","Extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs), where a compact object orbits a massive black hole, are a key source of gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Due to their small mass ratio, ($ε\sim 10^{-4}$--$10^{-7}$), the binary evolves slowly and EMRI signals will be in-band for years. Additionally, astrophysical EMRIs are expected to have complex dynamics featuring both spin-precession and eccentricity. A standard approach to modelling these inspirals is via the method of osculating geodesics (OG) which we employ along with a toy model for the gravitational self-force. Using this method requires resolving tens of thousands radial and polar orbital librations over the long duration of the signal which makes the inspiral trajectory expensive to compute. In this work we accelerate these calculations by employing Near-Identity (averaging) Transformations. However, this averaging technique breaks down at orbital resonances where the radial and polar frequencies are an integer ratio of each other. Thus, we switch to a partial averaging transformation in the vicinity of the resonance where the dynamics are characterised by the slow evolution of the so-called ""resonant phase"". Additionally, we develop an optimal switching criterion to minimise the computation time while maximising accuracy. We find the error in the waveform phase is improved from $\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/2})$ in the fully averaged scheme to $\mathcal{O}(ε^{4/7})$ in the switching scheme. At the same time, this scheme improves the scaling of the computation time from being inversely proportional to $ε$ using OG, to a very weak scaling with $ε$.

We interpret these quantum-corrected metrics as asymptotically-AdS solitons, and study the mass of these solitons as a function of the temperature of the quantum scalar field.",{'einstein equations': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum encoder for fixed Hamming-weight subspaces,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20408v1,"Renato M. S. Farias, Thiago O. Maciel, Giancarlo Camilo, Ruge Lin, Sergi Ramos-Calderer, Leandro Aolita","We present an exact $n$-qubit computational-basis amplitude encoder of real- or complex-valued data vectors of $d=\binom{n}{k}$ components into a subspace of fixed Hamming weight $k$. This represents a polynomial space compression. The circuit is optimal in that it expresses an arbitrary data vector using only $d-1$ (controlled) Reconfigurable Beam Splitter (RBS) gates and is constructed by an efficient classical algorithm that sequentially generates all bitstrings of weight $k$ and identifies all gate parameters. An explicit compilation into CNOTs and single-qubit gates is presented, with the total CNOT-gate count of $\mathcal{O}(k\, d)$ provided in analytical form. In addition, we show how to load data in the binary basis by sequentially stacking encoders of different Hamming weights using $\mathcal{O}(d\,\log(d))$ CNOT gates. Moreover, using generalized RBS gates that mix states of different Hamming weights, we extend the construction to efficiently encode arbitrary sparse vectors. Finally, we perform an experimental proof-of-principle demonstration of our scheme on a commercial trapped-ion quantum computer. We successfully upload a $q$-Gaussian probability distribution in the non-log-concave regime with $n = 6$ and $k = 2$. We also showcase how the effect of hardware noise can be alleviated by quantum error mitigation.

A single cryogenic Fourier transform spectrometer compares the sky to an external blackbody calibration target, measuring the Stokes I, Q, U parameters to levels ~200 Jy/sr in each 2.65 degree diameter beam over the full sky, in each of 300 frequency channels from 28 GHz to 6 THz. With sensitivity over 1000 times greater than COBE/FIRAS, PIXIE opens a broad discovery space for the origin, contents, and evolution of the universe. Measurements of small distortions from a CMB blackbody spectrum provide a robust determination of the mean electron pressure and temperature in the universe while constraining processes including dissipation of primordial density perturbations, black holes, and the decay or annihilation of dark matter. Full-sky maps of linear polarization measure the optical depth to reionization at nearly the cosmic variance limit and constrain models of primordial inflation. Spectra with sub-percent absolute calibration spanning microwave to far-IR wavelengths provide a legacy data set for analyses including line intensity mapping of extragalactic emission and the cosmic infrared background amplitude and anisotropy.

The key idea is to place the boundary ensemble on a Riemann surface of very high genus, where the duality trivializes. The duality relation at finite genus is then obtained by genus reduction. Our derivation is generic and does not rely on an explicit form of the bulk or boundary partition functions. It guarantees unitarity and suggests that the bulk sum should include all possible topologies.

We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are much shorter than the year-long exposures obtained by NICER on some individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing.

Predicting secondary structure of mRNA is one such notoriously difficult problem that can benefit from the ever-increasing maturity of quantum computing technology. Accurate prediction of mRNA secondary structure is critical in designing RNA-based therapeutics as it dictates various steps of an mRNA life cycle, including transcription, translation, and decay. The current generation of quantum computers have reached utility-scale, allowing us to explore relatively large problem sizes. In this paper, we examine the feasibility of solving mRNA secondary structures on a quantum computer with sequence length up to 60 nucleotides representing problems in the qubit range of 10 to 80.

The galaxies in this stellar-mass-controlled sample (log$_{10}$M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\sim$ 10.2-10.9 M$_{\odot}$) host super-massive black holes (SMBHs) with dynamically-measured masses spanning log$_{10}$M$_\mathrm{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$ $\sim$ 6.8-8.4; this allows us to compare our results with models of galaxy formation where the integrated feedback history from the SMBH alters the CGM over long timescales. We find that the \ion{C}{IV} column density measurements (N$_{\rm C IV}$) (average log$_{10}$N$_{\rm C IV, CH}$ = 13.94$\pm$0.09 cm$^{-2}$) are largely consistent with existing measurements from other surveys of N$_{\rm C IV}$ in the CGM (average log$_{10}$N$_{\rm C IV, Lit}$ = 13.90$\pm$0.08 cm$^{-2}$), but do not show obvious variation as a function of the SMBH mass. In contrast, specific star-formation rate (sSFR) is highly correlated with the ionized content of the CGM. We find a large spread in sSFR for galaxies with log$_{10}$M$_\mathrm{BH}$/M$_{\odot}$ $>$ 7.0, where the CGM \ion{C}{IV} content shows clear dependence on galaxy sSFR but not M$_\mathrm{BH}$.

The second are orthogonal (Hamming-weight preserving) quantum neural networks which provide well-defined and interpretable transformations on data but are challenging to train at scale on quantum devices. Density commuting QNNs improve capacity with minimal gradient complexity overhead, and density orthogonal neural networks admit a quadratic-to-constant gradient query advantage with minimal to no performance loss.

These results can be interpreted as providing covariant formulations of the gravitational force implied by a distribution of black holes in superposition. They can also be understood as a distribution of quantum matter constituents in superposition for a single black hole. A detailed analysis in the weak-field limit reveals quantum corrections to Newton's potential in generic semiclassical states, as well as new bounds on quantum fluctuations, implied by the covariance condition, rather than the usual uncertainty principle.

Stars initially more massive than about 8M_sun leave behind neutron stars and black holes by the end of their evolution. The merging of binary compact remnant systems produces astrophysical transients detectable by gravitational wave observatories. Studies of magnetic fields in massive stars with low metallicities are of particular interest because they provide important information on the role of magnetic fields in the star formation of the early Universe. While several detections of massive Galactic magnetic stars have been reported in the last few decades, the impact of a low-metallicity environment on the occurrence and strength of stellar magnetic fields has not yet been explored. Because of the similarity between Of?p stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) and Galactic magnetic Of?p stars, which possess globally organised magnetic fields, we searched for magnetic fields in Of?p stars in the MCs. Additionally, we observed the massive contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 in the Small Magellanic Cloud to test the theoretical scenario that the origin of magnetic fields involves a merger event or a common envelope evolution. We obtained and analysed measurements of the magnetic field in four massive Of?p stars in the MCs and the binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7 using the ESO/VLT FORS2 spectrograph in spectropolarimetric mode. We detected kilogauss-scale magnetic fields in two Of?p-type stars and in the contact binary Cl* NGC 346 SSN7.

For this purpose, we first extract topological black hole solutions in $F(R)$% -ModMax gravity's rainbow. Then, by considering black holes as thermodynamic systems, we obtain thermodynamic quantities and check the first law of thermodynamics. The effect of the topological parameter on the Hawking temperature and the total mass of black holes is obvious. We also discuss the thermodynamic topology of topological black holes in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity's rainbow using the off-shell free energy method. In this formalism, black holes are assumed to be equivalent to defects in their thermodynamic spaces. For our analysis, we consider two different types of thermodynamic ensembles. These are: fixed $q$ ensemble and fixed $φ$ ensemble. We take into account all the different types of curvature hypersurfaces that can be constructed in these black holes. The local and global topology of these black holes are studied by computing the topological charges at the defects in their thermodynamic spaces. Finally, in accordance with their topological charges, we classify the black holes into three topological classes with total winding numbers corresponding to $-1, 0$, and $1$.

Improving the Fidelity of CNOT Circuits on NISQ Hardware,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19891v1,"Dohun Kim, Minyoung Kim, Sarah Meng Li, Michele Mosca","We introduce an improved CNOT synthesis algorithm that considers nearest-neighbour interactions and CNOT gate error rates in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. Compared to IBM's Qiskit compiler, it improves the fidelity of a synthesized CNOT circuit by about 2 times on average (up to 9 times). It lowers the synthesized CNOT count by a factor of 13 on average (up to a factor of 162).
  Our contribution is twofold. First, we define a $\textsf{Cost}$ function by approximating the average gate fidelity $F_{avg}$. According to the simulation results, $\textsf{Cost}$ fits the error probability of a noisy CNOT circuit, $\textsf{Prob} = 1 - F_{avg}$, much tighter than the commonly used cost functions. On IBM's fake Nairobi backend, it matches $\textsf{Prob}$ to within $10^{-3}$. On other backends, it fits $\textsf{Prob}$ to within $10^{-1}$. $\textsf{Cost}$ accurately quantifies the dynamic error characteristics and shows remarkable scalability. Second, we propose a noise-aware CNOT routing algorithm, NAPermRowCol, by adapting the leading Steiner-tree-based connectivity-aware CNOT synthesis algorithms. A weighted edge is used to encode a CNOT gate error rate and $\textsf{Cost}$-instructed heuristics are applied to each reduction step. NAPermRowCol does not use ancillary qubits and is not restricted to certain initial qubit maps. Compared with algorithms that are noise-agnostic, it improves the fidelity of a synthesized CNOT circuit across varied NISQ hardware. Depending on the benchmark circuit and the IBM backend selected, it lowers the synthesized CNOT count up to $56.95\%$ compared to ROWCOL and up to $21.62\%$ compared to PermRowCol. It reduces the synthesis $\textsf{Cost}$ up to $25.71\%$ compared to ROWCOL and up to $9.12\%$ compared to PermRowCol.

In this study, we revisit the method to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic fields on small scales in the radiation-dominated era from the abundance of primordial black holes. Constraints in the previous work were based on the fact that the density perturbations sourced by stronger magnetic fields become large enough to gravitationally collapse to form PBHs. However, we demonstrate that this picture is incomplete because magnetic fields also increase the threshold value of the density contrast required for PBH formation. The increase in threshold density contrast is more pronounced on smaller scales, and in extreme cases, it might even prevent PBH production despite the presence of significant magnetic field. Taking into account the relevant physical effects on the magnetized overdense region, we establish an upper-limit on the amplitude of comoving magnetic fields, approximately $0.12-0.14 {\rm μG}$ at a scale of $10^{17} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$.

The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation of the polytropic gas sphere is ultimately a hydrostatic equilibrium equation developed from the general relativity framework. In the modified Rieman Liouville (mRL) frame, we formulate the fractional TOV (FTOV) equations and introduce an analytical solution. Using power series expansions to solve the fractional TOV equations yields a limited physical range to the convergent power series solution. Therefore, the two techniques of Euler-Abel transformation and Pade approximation have been combined to improve the convergence of the obtained series solutions. For all possible values of the relativistic parameters (σ), we calculated twenty fractional gas models for the polytropic indexes n=0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. Investigating the impacts of fractional and relativistic parameters on the models revealed fascinating phenomena; the two effects for n=0.5 are that the sphere's volume and mass decrease with increasing σand the fractional parameter (α). For n=1, the volume decreases when σ=0.1 and then increases when σ=0.2 and 0.3. The volume of the sphere reduces as both σand αincrease for n=1.5 and n=2. We calculated the maximum mass and the corresponding minimum radius of the white dwarfs modeled with polytropic index n=3 and several fractional and relativistic parameter values. We obtained a mass limit for the white dwarfs somewhat near the Chandrasekhar limit for the integer models with small relativistic parameters (α=1, σ=0.001).

Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19446v1,"Erica Bertolini, Alberto Blasi, Nicola Maggiore, Daniel Sacco Shaikh","Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.",{'holography': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Holography']

Quasar activity has long been associated with galaxy mergers, so here we investigate if supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) are preferentially found in quasars. Our multimessenger investigation folds together a gravitational wave background signal from NANOGrav, a sample of periodic AGN candidates from the Catalina Real-Time Transient Survey, and a quasar mass function, to estimate an upper limit on the fraction of quasars which could host a SMBHB. We find at 95\% confidence that quasars are at most seven times as likely to host a SMBHB as a random galaxy.

Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19392v1,"Moritz S. Fischer, Laura Sagunski","Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiraling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealized N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiraling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.",{'black holes': 3},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR), are inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED). For galaxies triggering SMBH activity, the active galactic nucleus (AGN) contaminates the light at all wavelengths, hampering the inference of galaxy parameters. Incomplete AGN templates can lead to systematic overestimates of the stellar mass, biasing our understanding of AGN-galaxy co-evolution. This challenge has gained further impetus with the advent of sensitive wide-area surveys with millions of luminous AGN, including by eROSITA, Euclid and LSST. We aim to estimate the accuracy and bias of AGN host galaxy parameters and improve upon existing techniques. This work makes two contributions: 1) a new SED fitting code, GRAHSP, with a flexible, empirically motivated AGN model including a power law continuum emission lines, a FeII forest and a flexible infrared torus. We verify that our model reproduces published X-ray to infrared SEDs of AGN to better than 20\% accuracy. A fully Bayesian fit with nested sampling includes uncertainties in the model and the data, making the inference highly robust. 2) we created a benchmark photometric dataset where pure quasars are merged with non-AGN pure galaxies into a hybrid (Chimera) object but with known galaxy and AGN properties. Comparing the true and retrieved $M_\star$, SFR and AGN luminosities shows that previous codes systematically over-estimate $M_\star$ and SFR by 0.5 dex with a wide scatter of 0.7 dex, at AGN luminosities above 10^44 erg/s. In contrast, GRAHSP shows no bias on $M_\star$ and SFR. GRAHSP also estimates more realistic uncertainties.

Detecting the Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background from Primordial Black Holes in Slow-reheating Scenarios,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19271v1,"Luis E. Padilla, Juan Carlos Hidalgo, Karim A. Malik, David Mulryne","After primordial inflation, the universe may have experienced a prolonged reheating epoch, potentially leading to a phase of matter domination supported by the oscillating inflaton field. During such an epoch, perturbations in the inflaton virialize upon reentering the cosmological horizon, forming inflaton structures. If the primordial overdensities are sufficiently large, these structures collapse to form primordial black holes (PBHs). To occur at a significant rate, this process requires an enhanced primordial power spectrum (PPS) at small scales. The enhancement of the PPS, as well as the formation and tidal interaction of the primordial structures, will in turn source a stochastic gravitational wave background(SGWB) that could be detected by current and/or future gravitational wave detectors. In this paper, we study the SGWB arising from these different sources during slow-reheating, focusing on a PPS that satisfies the requirements necessary for the formation of PBHs with a mass of $M_{\rm PBH}\simeq 10^{21}$ and that constitute the entirety of dark matter in the universe.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We leverage PM data to construct a complete inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model for non-precessing spinning black holes within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism: SEOBNR-PM.

Quantum Circuit Switching with One-Way Repeaters in Star Networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.19049v1,"Álvaro G. Iñesta, Hyeongrak Choi, Dirk Englund, Stephanie Wehner","Distributing quantum states reliably among distant locations is a key challenge in the field of quantum networks. One-way quantum networks address this by using one-way communication and quantum error correction. Here, we analyze quantum circuit switching as a protocol to distribute quantum states in one-way quantum networks. In quantum circuit switching, pairs of users can request the delivery of multiple quantum states from one user to the other. After waiting for approval from the network, the states can be distributed either sequentially, forwarding one at a time along a path of quantum repeaters, or in parallel, sending batches of quantum states from repeater to repeater. Since repeaters can only forward a finite number of quantum states at a time, a pivotal question arises: is it advantageous to send them sequentially (allowing for multiple requests simultaneously) or in parallel (reducing processing time but handling only one request at a time)? We compare both approaches in a quantum network with a star topology. Using tools from queuing theory, we show that requests are met at a higher rate when packets are distributed in parallel, although sequential distribution can generally provide service to a larger number of users simultaneously. We also show that using a large number of quantum repeaters to combat channel losses limits the maximum distance between users, as each repeater introduces additional processing delays.

However, we are currently in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where devices are relatively small and suffer from substantial noise levels, prohibiting large-scale computations. To achieve any quantum advantage in this regime and beyond, it is crucial to minimise the impact of noise from qubit decoherence and two-qubit gates. A direct approach is to improve the optimisation of quantum circuit compilation processes that map circuits onto physical devices, thereby reducing noisy gates and circuit execution times.

Under the assumption that the early Universe is dominated by dwarf galaxies, we investigate the hypothesis that dwarf-dwarf galaxy interactions trigger black hole accretion.

We present WISE2MBH, an efficient algorithm that uses cataloged Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) magnitudes to estimate total stellar mass ($M_*$) and scale this to bulge mass ($M_\text{Bulge}$), and $M_\text{BH}$, estimating the morphological type ($T_\text{Type}$) and bulge fraction ($B/T$) in the process. WISE2MBH uses scaling relations from the literature or developed in this work, providing a streamlined approach to derive these parameters. It also distinguishes QSOs from galaxies and estimates the galaxy $T_\text{Type}$ using WISE colors with a relation trained with galaxies from the 2MASS Redshift Survey. WISE2MBH performs well up to $z\sim0.5$ thanks to K-corrections in magnitudes and colors. WISE2MBH $M_\text{BH}$ estimates agree very well with those of a selected sample of local galaxies with $M_\text{BH}$ measurements or reliable estimates: a Spearman score of $\sim$0.8 and a RMSE of $\sim$0.63 were obtained. When applied to the ETHER sample at $z\leq0.5$, WISE2MBH provides $\sim$1.9 million $M_\text{BH}$ estimates (78.5\% new) and $\sim$100 thousand upper limits.

Quantum Active Learning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18230v1,"Yongcheng Ding, Yue Ban, Mikel Sanz, José D. Martín-Guerrero, Xi Chen","Quantum machine learning, as an extension of classical machine learning that harnesses quantum mechanics, facilitates effiient learning from data encoded in quantum states. Training a quantum neural network typically demands a substantial labeled training set for supervised learning. Human annotators, often experts, provide labels for samples through additional experiments, adding to the training cost. To mitigate this expense, there is a quest for methods that maintain model performance over fully labeled datasets while requiring fewer labeled samples in practice, thereby extending few-shot learning to the quantum realm. Quantum active learning estimates the uncertainty of quantum data to select the most informative samples from a pool for labeling. Consequently, a QML model is supposed to accumulate maximal knowledge as the training set comprises labeled samples selected via sampling strategies. Notably, the QML models trained within the QAL framework are not restricted to specific types, enabling performance enhancement from the model architecture's perspective towards few-shot learning. Recognizing symmetry as a fundamental concept in physics ubiquitous across various domains, we leverage the symmetry inherent in quantum states induced by the embedding of classical data for model design. We employ an equivariant QNN capable of generalizing from fewer data with geometric priors. We benchmark the performance of QAL on two classification problems, observing both positive and negative results. QAL effectively trains the model, achieving performance comparable to that on fully labeled datasets by labeling less than 7\% of the samples in the pool with unbiased sampling behavior. Furthermore, we elucidate the negative result of QAL being overtaken by random sampling baseline through miscellaneous numerical experiments.

The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18129v2,Hugo Holland,"Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.",{'black holes': 3},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Massive Black Hole Seeds,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17975v1,"John Regan, Marta Volonteri","The pathway(s) to seeding the massive black holes (MBHs) that exist at the heart of galaxies in the present and distant Universe remains an unsolved problem. Here we categorise, describe and quantitatively discuss the formation pathways of both $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds. We emphasise that the most recent computational models suggest that rather than a bimodal-like mass spectrum between $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds with $\textit{light}$ at one end and $\textit{heavy}$ at the other that instead a continuum exists. $\textit{Light}$ seeds being more ubiquitous and the heavier seeds becoming less and less abundant due the rarer environmental conditions required for their formation. We therefore examine the different mechanisms that give rise to different seed mass spectrums. We show how and why the mechanisms that produce the $\textit{heaviest}$ seeds are also among the rarest events in the Universe and are hence extremely unlikely to be the seeds for the vast majority of the MBH population. We quantify, within the limits of the current large uncertainties in the seeding processes, the expected number densities of the seed mass spectrum. We argue that $\textit{light}$ seeds must be at least $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}$ times more numerous than $\textit{heavy}$ seeds to explain the MBH population as a whole. Based on our current understanding of the seed population this makes $\textit{heavy}$ seeds ($\rm{M_{seed}} > 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) a significantly more likely pathway given that $\textit{heavy}$ seeds have an abundance pattern than is close to and likely in excess of $10^{-4}$ compared to $\textit{light}$ seeds.

Goodwin, James C. A. Miller-Jones, Jerome A. Orosz, Jay Strader","Identifying sources exhibiting ellipsoidal variability in large photometric surveys is becoming a promising method to search for candidate detached black holes in binaries. This technique aims to exploit the orbital-phase dependent modulation in optical photometry caused by the black hole distorting the shape of the luminous star to constrain the mass ratio of the binary. Without understanding if, or how much, contamination is present in the candidate black hole samples produced by this new technique it is hard to leverage them for black hole discovery. Here, we follow up one of the best candidates identified from Gaia Data Release 3, Gaia DR3 4042390512917208960, with a radial velocity campaign. Combined photometric and radial velocity modelling, along with spectral disentangling, suggests that the true mass ratio (mass of the unseen object divided by the mass of the luminous star) is an order of magnitude smaller than that inferred assuming the modulations arise from ellipsoidal variability. We therefore infer that this system is likely a contact binary, or on the boundary of both stars nearly filling their Roche lobes, however, further observations are required to confidently detect the secondary. We find that the well-known problem of discriminating between ellipsoidal and contact binary light curves results in a larger contamination from contact binaries than previously suggested. Until ellipsoidal variables can be reliably distinguished from contact binaries, samples of black hole candidates selected based on ellipsoidal variability are likely to be highly contaminated by contact binaries or similar systems.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

By using simple commutation rules, a quantum circuit can be transpiled into a sequence of solely non-Clifford multi-qubit gates. Prior work on fault-tolerant compilation avoids optimal scheduling of such gates since they reduce the parallelizability of the circuit. We observe that the reduced parallelization potential is outweighed by the significant reduction in the number of gates. We therefore devise a method for scheduling multi-qubit lattice surgery using an earliest-available-first policy, solving the associated forest packing problem using a representation of the multi-qubit gates as Steiner trees. Our extensive testing on random and application-inspired circuits demonstrates the method's scalability and performance.

In addition to the known effects of particle production and entropy dilution resulting from PBH evaporation, we find that the generation of dark matter (DM) through CGPP is profoundly influenced by a possible era of PBH matter domination. This early matter dominated era results in an enhancement of the particle spectrum from CGPP. Specifically, it amplifies the peak comoving momentum $k_\star$ for spin-1 DM, while enhancing the plateau of the spectrum for minimally coupled spin-0 particles for low comoving momenta. At the same time, the large entropy dilution may partially or completely compensate for the increase of the spectrum and strongly mitigates the DM abundance produced by CGPP. Our results show that, in the computation of the final abundance, CGPP and PBH evaporation cannot be disentangled, but the parameters of both sectors must be considered together to obtain the final result. Furthermore, we explore the potential formation of PBHs from density fluctuations arising from CGPP and the associated challenges in such a scenario.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Both the magnitude and time dependence of the correlator differ from previous results related to the spectral form factor, which estimated the correlator in a thermal state. Our results severely constrain proposals, such as non-violent unitarization and some versions of fuzzballs, that predict significant corrections to the semiclassical computation of correlation functions near black holes.

Strategic Code: A Unified Spatio-Temporal Framework for Quantum Error-Correction,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.17567v1,"Andrew Tanggara, Mile Gu, Kishor Bharti","Quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is the central ingredient in fault-tolerant quantum information processing. An emerging paradigm of dynamical QECC shows that one can robustly encode logical quantum information both temporally and spatially in a more resource-efficient manner than traditional QECCs. Nevertheless, an overarching theory of how dynamical QECCs achieve fault-tolerance is lacking. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing a unified spatio-temporal QECC framework called the ``strategic code'' built around an ``interrogator'' device which sequentially measures and evolves the spatial QECC in an adaptive manner based on the ``quantum combs'' formalism, a generalization of the channel-state duality. The strategic code covers all existing dynamical and static QECC, as well as all physically plausible QECCs to be discovered in the future, including those that involve adaptivity in its operational dynamics. Within this framework, we show an algebraic and an information-theoretic necessary and sufficient error-correction conditions for a strategic code, which consider spatially and temporally correlated errors. These conditions include the analogous known static QECC conditions as a special case. Lastly, we also propose an optimization-theoretic approach to obtain an approximate strategic code adapting to a correlated error.",{'quantum error-correcting code': 1},05.2024,2024,05,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Peaked sources (PS) represent a class of AGN at the first stage of evolution, characterised by a peaked radio spectrum. Among these radio sources, low-luminosity compact (LLC) sources can be identified as PS accreting with a high Eddington rate, harbouring low-power jets and hosting low-mass black holes. These properties are also shared by narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s). In 2016, LLCs were hypothesised to be the parent population of NLS1s with a flat radio spectrum (F-NLS1s), suggesting the former to be the same objects as the latter, seen at higher inclination. Based on radio luminosity functions and optical spectra analysis, 10 LLCs were identified as valid candidates for F-NLS1s. To account for the missing puzzle piece, verifying if these LLCs could be hosted in late-type galaxies as NLS1s, we performed the photometric decomposition of their Pan-STARRS1 images in all five filters. We used the 2D fitting algorithm GALFIT for the single-band analysis, and its extension GALFITM for the multi-band analysis. Considering that the morphological type and the structural parameters of the host can be dependent on the wavelength, we found six out of ten LLCs hosted in late-type galaxies, probably with pseudo-bulges, three point-like sources and one object of uncertain classification. Although this study is based on a small sample, it represents the first morphological analysis of LLC host galaxies.

Hopkins","The origins and mergers of supermassive black holes (BHs) remain a mystery. We describe a scenario from a novel multi-physics simulation featuring rapid ($\lesssim 1\,$Myr) hyper-Eddington gas capture by a $\sim 1000\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$ ``seed'' BH up to supermassive ($\gtrsim 10^{6}\,M_{\odot}$) masses, in a massive, dense molecular cloud complex typical of high-redshift starbursts. Due to the high cloud density, stellar feedback is inefficient and most of the gas turns into stars in star clusters which rapidly merge hierarchically, creating deep potential wells. Relatively low-mass BH seeds at random positions can be ``captured'' by merging sub-clusters and migrate to the center in $\sim1$ free-fall time (vastly faster than dynamical friction). This also efficiently produces a paired BH binary with $\sim 0.1$\,pc separation. The centrally-concentrated stellar density profile (akin to a ``proto-bulge'') allows the cluster as a whole to capture and retain gas and build up a large (pc-scale) circum-binary accretion disk with gas coherently funnelled to the central BH (even when the BH radius of influence is small). The disk is ``hyper-magnetized'' and ``flux-frozen'': dominated by a toroidal magnetic field with plasma $β\sim 10^{-3}$, with the fields amplified by flux-freezing. This drives hyper-Eddington inflow rates $\gtrsim 1\,\rm M_\odot yr^{-1}$, which also drive the two BHs to nearly-equal masses. The late-stage system appears remarkably similar to recently-observed high-redshift ``little red dots.'' This scenario can provide an explanation for rapid SMBH formation, growth and mergers in high-redshift galaxies.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $τ-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side.

We find that GW capture during resonant interactions is most efficient if $q_2\simeq q_3$ and that the mass-ratio distribution of BBH coalescence due to inspirals is $\propto m_1^{-1}q^{2.9+α}$, where $α$ is the exponent of the BH mass function. The total rate of GW captures and inspirals depends mostly on $m_1$ and is relatively insensitive to $q_2$ and $q_3$. We show that eccentricity increase by non-resonant encounters approximately doubles the rate of BBH inspiral in between resonant encounters. For a given GC mass and radius, the BBH merger rate in metal-rich GCs is approximately double that of metal-poor GCs, because of their (on average) lower BH masses ($m_1$) and steeper BH mass function, yielding binaries with lower $q$. Our results enable the translating from the mass-ratio distribution of dynamically formed BBH mergers to the underlying BH mass function. The additional mechanism that leads to a doubling of the inspirals provides an explanation for the reported high fraction of in-cluster inspirals in $N$-body models of clusters.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in magnetized black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16941v2,Shao-Jun Zhang,"The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, energy extraction conditions, power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive to energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Geometrically Thick Disks around Kerr Black Holes in a Swirling Universe,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16758v1,"Kristian Gjorgjieski, Rogério Capobianco","We investigate geometrically thick disks around Kerr black holes in a swirling universe. This stationary and axisymmetric spacetime is composed of a Kerr black hole, which is immersed in a swirling background. The swirling background is characterized by an odd $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry, where the northern and southern hemispheres are rotating in opposite directions. The Kerr and swirling rotations can lead to the emergence of complex spin-spin interactions, which heavily influence the spacetime properties. In order to study this influence, we analyze prograde as well as retrograde circular orbits and geometrically thick disks for different spacetime solutions, which are classified by their Kerr parameter $a$ and the swirling parameter $j$. We find stabilizing effects on prograde circular orbits and destabilizing effects on retrograde circular orbits, which originate from the spin-spin interaction and depend mainly on the Kerr rotation. Furthermore, the background rotation leads to an emergence of static orbits and the symmetry breaking regarding the equatorial plane causes a vertical distribution of the circular orbits and thick torus solutions. Due to the destabilizing effect of the swirling rotation, an outer marginally stable orbit appears, which heavily downsizes the parameter space for disk solutions. Dependent on the Keplerian specific angular momentum distribution of the spacetime and on the disk momentum $\ell_0$, different types of disk are possible which we classify and which differ in terms of the complex disk dynamics that could arise due to the presence of an inner and outer cusp or just an outer cusp.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We explore the influence of charge on the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ and the Page time. Due to their distinct geometric structures, we discuss non-extremal and extremal charged black holes separately. In non-extremal cases, the emergence of island saves the bound of entropy at late times, and the entanglement entropy of Hawking radiation satisfies the Page curve. Moreover, we also find that the position of the boundary of island $\partial I$ depends on the position of the cutoff surface (observers), differing from the behavior in eternal charged black holes. In extremal black holes, when the island exists, the entanglement entropy is approximately equal to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, while the entanglement entropy becomes ill-defined when island is absent. Our analysis underscores how different geometric configurations significantly influence the behavior of entropy.","{'black holes': 5, 'hawking radiation': 2}",05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We self-consistently solve the GRMHD equations that govern the flow motion inside the disk and for the first time to our knowledge, we obtain the shock-induced global GRMHD accretion solutions around weakly as well as rapidly rotating black holes for a set of fundamental flow parameters, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($L$), radial magnetic flux ($Φ$), and iso-rotation parameter ($F$). We show that shock properties, namely shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$), compression ratio ($R$) and shock strength ($Ψ$) strongly depends on $E$, $L$, $Φ$, and $F$. We observe that shock in GRMHD flow continues to exist for wide range of the flow parameters, which allows us to identify the effective domain of parameter space in $L-E$ plane where shock solutions are feasible. Moreover, we examine the modification of the shock parameter space and find that it shifts towards the lower angular momentum values with increasing $Φ$ and black hole spin ($a_{\rm k}$).

Mitigation of self-generated RFI using ASKAP&#39;s phased array feeds,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16309v1,"Liroy Lourenco, Aaron P Chippendale","This paper presents the effects of radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation on a radio telescope's sensitivity and beam pattern. It specifically explores the impact of subspace-projection mitigation on the phased array feed (PAF) beams of the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope. The goal is to demonstrate ASKAP's ability to make science observations during active RFI mitigation. The target interfering signal is a self-generated clock signal from the digital receivers of ASKAP's PAFs. This signal is stationary, so we apply the mitigation projection to the beamformer weights at the beginning of the observation and hold them fixed. We suppressed the unwanted narrowband signal by 31dB, to the noise floor of an 880s integration on one antenna, with a typical degradation in sensitivity of just 1.5%. Sensitivity degradation over the whole 36 antenna array of 3.1% was then measured via interferometric assessment of system equivalent flux density (SEFD). These measurements are in line with theoretical calculation of noise increase using the correlation of the beam weights and RFI spatial signature. Further, degradation to the main beam's gain is 0.4% on average at the half-power point, with no significant change to the gain in the first sidelobe and no variation during extended observations; also consistent with our modelling. In summary, we present the first demonstration of mitigation via spatial nulling with PAFs on a large aperture synthesis array telescope and assess impact on sensitivity and beam shape via SEFD and holography measurements. The mitigation introduces smaller changes to sensitivity than intrinsic sensitivity differences between beams, does not preclude high dynamic range imaging and, in continuum 1MHz mode, recovers an otherwise corrupted holography beam map and usable astronomical source correlations in the RFI-affected channel.",{'holography': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Holography']

Utilizing the Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ) and Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) methods, a QPO signal was identified at a frequency of 2.19 * 10^-4 Hz (4566 s), with a confidence level of 3.6 sigma. The signal was notably absent in the lower 0.2-1.0 keV energy band, with the primary contribution emerging from the 2.0-10.0 keV band, where the confidence level reached 3.9 sigma.

The main result of this study is that no further scalar mode appears more than the two standard plus and cross transverse polarizations of massless tensor gravitational radiation, typical of General Relativity. This is because the first-order perturbation of connection does not modify the linearized field equations in vacuum which remain gauge invariant. Then, the world line equations of free point particles, as well as the equations of their deviations, are obtained using only the symmetric teleparallel connection. In $f(Q)$ gravity, test masses follow timelike geodesics and not autoparallel curves. In the proper reference frame, thanks to the geodesic deviation equation of the structure-less bodies in free fall, we prove that, in any gauge, only the metric perturbations $h_{μν}$, related to tensor modes, survive by exploiting the gauge invariance. Besides, scalar modes disappear. This allows us to conclude that only two degrees of freedom of linearized $f(Q)$ non-metric gravity propagate as in General Relativity and in $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity. The situation is different with respect to $f(R)$ gravity (with $f(R)\neq R$) where a further scalar mode is found.",{'geodesics': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We find that, depending on the timing of modification to the semi-classical approximation and the efficiency of the backreaction, it is possible to produce the correct DM abundance for PBHs with masses $\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ g, whereas producing the right amount of baryon asymmetry requires light PBHs with masses $\lesssim\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ g, satisfying bounds on the PBH mass from the Cosmic Microwave Background and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. However, in a simplistic scenario, achieving both {\it simultaneously} is not feasible, typically because of the stringent Lyman-$α$ constraint on warm dark matter mass. We also demonstrate how induced gravitational waves from PBH density fluctuations can provide a window to test the memory-burden effects, thereby placing constraints on either the DM mass scale or the scale of leptogenesis.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Complementarity for a Dynamical Black Hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15849v1,"Benjamin Concepcion, Yasunori Nomura, Kyle Ritchie, Samuel Weiss","Black hole complementarity posits that the interior of a black hole is not independent from its Hawking radiation. This leads to an apparent violation of causality: the interior can be acausally affected by operators acting solely on the radiation. We argue that this perspective is misleading and that the black hole interior must be viewed as existing in the causal past of the Hawking radiation, despite the fact that they are spacelike separated in the semiclassical description. Consequently, no operation on the Hawking radiation -- no matter how complex -- can affect the experience of an infalling observer. The black hole interior and the radiation only appear spacelike separated in the semiclassical description because an infalling observer's ability to access complex information is limited; the chaotic dynamics on the horizon, as viewed from the exterior, then converts any effect caused by such an observer to information in the Hawking radiation which cannot be accessed at the semiclassical level. We arrive at the picture described above by considering a unitary exterior description in which the flow of information is strictly causal, which we extend to apply throughout the entire history of black hole evolution, including its formation. This description uses the stretched event horizon as an inner edge of spacetime, on which the information inside is holographically encoded. We argue that the global spacetime picture arises from coarse-graining over black hole microstates, and discuss its relationship with the exterior description.",{'hawking radiation': 4},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Single-Round Proofs of Quantumness from Knowledge Assumptions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15736v1,"Petia Arabadjieva, Alexandru Gheorghiu, Victor Gitton, Tony Metger","A proof of quantumness is an efficiently verifiable interactive test that an efficient quantum computer can pass, but all efficient classical computers cannot (under some cryptographic assumption). Such protocols play a crucial role in the certification of quantum devices. Existing single-round protocols (like asking the quantum computer to factor a large number) require large quantum circuits, whereas multi-round ones use smaller circuits but require experimentally challenging mid-circuit measurements. As such, current proofs of quantumness are out of reach for near-term devices.
  In this work, we construct efficient single-round proofs of quantumness based on existing knowledge assumptions. While knowledge assumptions have not been previously considered in this context, we show that they provide a natural basis for separating classical and quantum computation. Specifically, we show that multi-round protocols based on Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) or Learning With Errors (LWE) can be ""compiled"" into single-round protocols using a knowledge-of-exponent assumption or knowledge-of-lattice-point assumption, respectively. We also prove an adaptive hardcore-bit statement for a family of claw-free functions based on DDH, which might be of independent interest.
  Previous approaches to constructing single-round protocols relied on the random oracle model and thus incurred the overhead associated with instantiating the oracle with a cryptographic hash function. In contrast, our protocols have the same resource requirements as their multi-round counterparts without necessitating mid-circuit measurements, making them, arguably, the most efficient single-round proofs of quantumness to date. Our work also helps in understanding the interplay between black-box/white-box reductions and cryptographic assumptions in the design of proofs of quantumness.",{'quantum computer': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The first method evolves corrections to general relativity order by order in a perturbative expansion, while the second method introduces extra dynamical fields in such a way that strong hyperbolicity is recovered. We use shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity as a benchmark theory to illustrate the differences between these methods for several spacetimes of physical interest. We study the formation of scalar hair about initially non-spinning black holes, the collision of black holes with scalar charge, and the inspiral and merger of binary black holes. By directly comparing predictions, we assess the extent to which those from the approximate treatments can be meaningfully confronted with gravitational wave observations. We find that the order-by-order approach cannot faithfully track the solutions when the corrections to general relativity are non-negligible.

While it is known that the use of probabilistic synthesis already suppresses such coherent errors quadratically, there is no clear understanding on its remnant error, which hinders us from designing a holistic error countermeasure that is effectively combined with error suppression and mitigation. In this work, we propose that, by exploiting the fact that synthesis error can be characterized completely and efficiently, we can craft the remnant error of probabilistic synthesis such that the error profile satisfies desirable properties. We prove for the case of single-qubit unitary synthesis that, there is a guaranteed way to perform probabilistic synthesis such that we can craft the remnant error to be described by Pauli and depolarizing errors, while the conventional twirling cannot be applied in principle. Furthermore, we show a numerical evidence for the synthesis of Pauli rotations based on Clifford+T formalism that, we can craft the remnant error so that it can be eliminated up to {\it cubic} order by combining logical measurement and feedback operations. As a result, Pauli rotation gates can be implemented with T counts of $\log_2(1/\varepsilon)$ on average up to accuracy of $\varepsilon=10^{-9}$, which can be applied to early fault-tolerant quantum computation beyond classical tractability.

To achieve this, we obtain numerical solutions of the GRH equations, utilizing Schwarzschild, Kerr, Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet, and Hartle-Thorne spacetime metrics. We investigate the impact of the rotation parameter of a black hole (a/M), the EGB coupling constant ($α$), and the quadrupole moment of the rotating black hole (q) on the accretion disk formed in a strong field. The formation of the disk for the slowly and rapidly rotating black hole models is separately examined, and comparisons are made. Our numerical simulations reveal that, under the specific conditions, the solution derived from Hartle-Thorne gravity converges towards solutions obtained from Kerr and other gravitational models. In the context of the slowly rotating black hole with $a/M=0.28$, we observe a favorable agreement between the Hartle-Thorne result and the Kerr result within the range of 0 < q < 0.5. Conversely, in the scenario of the rapidly rotating black hole, a more pronounced alignment with the value of q=1 is evident within the range of 0.5 < q < 1. Nevertheless, for q > 1, it becomes apparent that the Hartle-Thorne solution diverges from solutions provided by all gravitational models. Our motivation here is to utilize the Hartle-Thorne spacetime metric for the first time in the numerical solutions of the GRH equations for the black holes, compare the results with those obtained using other gravities, and identify under which conditions the Hartle-Thorne solution is compatible with known black hole spacetime metric solutions.

Superradiance Protects Unitary Evolution on the Boundary,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15295v1,Brett McInnes,"It has been argued that the rate at which the interior of an AdS black hole evolves is dual to the rate of unitary evolution of the strongly coupled matter on the boundary which, according to holography, is dual to the black hole. However, we have shown elsewhere that it seems to be possible, by adjusting the specific angular momentum of an AdS$_5$-Kerr black hole, to reduce this rate to (effectively) zero. We argue that this is unphysical, and that it is prevented by the intervention of a superradiant instability with a ``grey galaxy'' as the end state. We also argue that this claim (that unitary evolution is preserved by superradiance, and not by some other instability) might be confirmed by an experimental observation of a specific temperature-dependent upper bound on the specific angular momentum of actual strongly coupled matter -- $\,$ in particular, by the observation of such a bound in samples of the Quark-Gluon Plasma with extremely large vorticities.",{'holography': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Holography']

With the help of the ansatz of separation of variables, we successfully separate the polar part, and find the exact solution in terms of Spheroidal Harmonics, while the radial exact solution is obtained in terms of the Confluent Heun function. The quantization of the quasibound state is done by applying the polynomial condition of the Confluent Heun function that gives rise to discrete complex-valued energy levels for massive scalar fields. The real part is the scalar field relativistic quantized energy, while the imaginary part represents the quasibound states's decay. We present all of the sixteen possible exact energy solutions for both massive and massless scalars. We also present the investigation the Hawking radiation of the Dyonic Kerr-Sen black hole's apparent horizon, via the Sigurd-Sannan method by making use of the obtained exact scalar wave functions. The radiation distribution function, and the Hawking temperature are successfully obtained.",{'hawking radiation': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Active Galactic Nuclei and Host Galaxies in COSMOS-Web. II. First Look at the Kpc-scale Dual and Offset AGN Population,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14980v1,"Junyao Li, Ming-Yang Zhuang, Yue Shen, Marta Volonteri, Nianyi Chen, Tiziana Di Matteo","Kpc-scale dual and offset Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are signposts of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) triggered during late-stage galaxy mergers, offering crucial insights into the coevolution of SMBHs and galaxies. However, robustly confirmed systems at high redshift (e.g., $z>1$) are scarce and biased towards the most luminous and unobscured systems. In this study, we systematically search for kpc-scale (projected separation $<15$ kpc) dual and offset AGNs around 571 moderate-luminosity, X-ray-selected AGNs including the obscured population, utilizing deep HST ACS/F814W and multiband JWST NIRCam imaging from the COSMOS-Web survey. We identify 59 dual and 30 offset AGN candidates in late stage major mergers based on spatially-resolved spectral energy distribution analyses. This translates to $\sim28$ and $\sim10$ bona-fide dual and offset AGNs using a probabilistic pair counting scheme to minimize chance superpositions. Notably, the fraction of dual and offset AGNs among moderate-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol}\sim10^{43}-10^{46}\ \rm erg\ s^{-1}$), obscured AGNs is nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of the most luminous, unobscured quasar pairs. We find tentative evidence for an increasing pair fraction among AGNs with redshift (from a few percent at $z\sim 0.5$ to $\sim22.9_{-17.7}^{+27.5}\%$ at $z\sim4.5$) and a higher occurrence rate of dual over offset AGNs. There is no pileup of dual/offset AGNs below $\sim 2~{\rm kpc}$ separations. These results generally align with predictions from the ASTRID and Horizon-AGN cosmological simulations when matching sample selection criteria, implying a high probability of both BHs being active simultaneously in late-stage major mergers.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Scale-dependent chirality as a smoking gun for Abelian gauge fields during inflation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14963v1,"Ogan Özsoy, Alexandros Papageorgiou, Matteo Fasiello","Axion-inflation models are a compelling candidate as a mechanism behind the accelerated expansion in the early universe in light of the possibility to embed them in higher dimensional UV complete theories and the exciting prospect of testing them with next-generation cosmological probes. Adding an Abelian gauge sector to axion-inflation models makes for a rich, interesting, phenomenology spanning from primordial black holes to gravitational waves (GWs). Several recent studies employ an approximate analytic (Gaussian) template to characterize the effect of gauge field production on cosmological perturbations. In this work we go beyond such approximation and numerically study particle production and the ensuing scalar and tensor spectra. We find a significant deviation from results based on log-normally distributed vector field excitations. As an important phenomenological application of the improved method, we study the expected chirality and spectral index of the sourced GW background at scales relevant for current and next-generation GW detectors.

Residual eccentricity as a systematic uncertainty on the formation channels of binary black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14945v1,"Giulia Fumagalli, Isobel Romero-Shaw, Davide Gerosa, Viola De Renzis, Konstantinos Kritos, Aleksandra Olejak","Resolving the formation channel(s) of merging binary black holes is a key goal in gravitational-wave astronomy. The orbital eccentricity is believed to be a precious tracer of the underlying formation pathway, but is largely dissipated during the usually long inspiral between black-hole formation and merger. Most gravitational-wave sources are thus expected to enter the sensitivity windows of current detectors on configurations that are compatible with quasi-circular orbits. In this paper, we investigate the impact of ""negligible"" residual eccentricity -- lower than currently detectable by LIGO/Virgo -- on our ability to infer the formation history of binary black holes, focusing in particular on their spin orientations. We trace the evolution of both observed and synthetic gravitational-wave events backward in time, while resampling their residual eccentricities to values that are below the detectability threshold. Eccentricities in-band as low as $\sim 10^{-4}$ can lead to significant biases when reconstructing the spin directions, especially in the case of loud, highly precessing systems.

Replica Wormholes and Entanglement Islands in the Karch-Randall Braneworld,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14872v2,Hao Geng,"The Karch-Randall braneworld provides a natural set-up to study the Hawking radiation from a black hole using holographic tools. Such a black hole lives on a brane and is highly quantum yet has a holographic dual as a higher dimensional classical theory that lives in the ambient space. Moreover, such a black hole is coupled to a nongravitational bath which is absorbing its Hawking radiation. This allows us to compute the entropy of the Hawking radiation by studying the bath using the quantum extremal surface prescription. The quantum extremal surface geometrizes into a Ryu-Takayanagi surface in the ambient space. The topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface in time from connecting different portions of the bath to the one connecting the bath and the brane gives the Page curve of the Hawking radiation that is consistent with unitarity. Nevertheless, there doesn't exit a derivation of the quantum extremal surface prescription and its geometrization in the Karch-Randall braneworld. In this paper, we fill this gap. We mainly focus on the case that the ambient space is (2+1)-dimensional for which explicit computations can be done in each description of the set-up. We show that the topological phase transition of the Ryu-Takayanagi surface corresponds to the formation of the replica wormhole on the Karch-Randall brane as the dominate contribution to the replica path integral. For higher dimensional situations, we show that the geometry of the brane satisfies Einstein's equation coupled with conformal matter.

We give two different quantum algorithms that, given query access to the entries of a Hermitian matrix $A$ and assuming a constant eigenvalue gap, output a classical description of a good approximation of the top eigenvector: one algorithm with time complexity $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(d^{1.75})$ and one with time complexity $d^{1.5+o(1)}$ (the first algorithm has a slightly better dependence on the $\ell_2$-error of the approximating vector than the second, and uses different techniques of independent interest). Both of our quantum algorithms provide a polynomial speed-up over the best-possible classical algorithm, which needs $Ω(d^2)$ queries to entries of $A$, and hence $Ω(d^2)$ time. We extend this to a quantum algorithm that outputs a classical description of the subspace spanned by the top-$q$ eigenvectors in time $qd^{1.5+o(1)}$. We also prove a nearly-optimal lower bound of $\tildeΩ(d^{1.5})$ on the quantum query complexity of approximating the top eigenvector.
  Our quantum algorithms run a version of the classical power method that is robust to certain benign kinds of errors, where we implement each matrix-vector multiplication with small and well-behaved error on a quantum computer, in different ways for the two algorithms. Our first algorithm estimates the matrix-vector product one entry at a time, using a new ``Gaussian phase estimation'' procedure.

The main impediments to achieving this potential are the dynamic gate phase errors that cannot be corrected via calibration. The standard tool for countering such phase errors in two-level qubits is the echo protocol, often referred to as the dynamical decoupling sequence, where the evolution of a qubit is punctuated by an even number of X gates. We introduce basis cycling, which is a direct generalization of the qubit echo to general qudits, and provide a framework in which to design gate sequences to produce desired effects using this technique. We then apply basis cycling to a Toffoli gate decomposition incorporating a qutrit and obtain a CCZ gate fidelity of 93.8 +- 0.1 via quantum process tomography on an IBM quantum computer. The gate fidelity remains stable without recalibration even while the resonant frequency of the qutrit fluctuates, highlighting the dynamical nature of phase error cancellation through basis cycling. Our results demonstrate that one of the biggest difficulties in implementing qudit-based gate decompositions on superconducting quantum computers can be systematically overcome when certain conditions are met, and thus open a path toward fulfilling the promise of qudits as gate optimization agents.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Effects of Topological Boundary Conditions on Bell Nonlocality,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14587v1,"Patrick Emonts, Mengyao Hu, Albert Aloy, Jordi Tura","Bell nonlocality is the resource that enables device-independent quantum information processing tasks. It is revealed through the violation of so-called Bell inequalities, indicating that the observed correlations cannot be reproduced by any local hidden variable model. While well explored in few-body settings, the question of which Bell inequalities are best suited for a given task remains quite open in the many-body scenario. One natural approach is to assign Bell inequalities to physical Hamiltonians, mapping their interaction graph to two-body, nearest-neighbor terms. Here, we investigate the effect of boundary conditions in a two-dimensional square lattice, which can induce different topologies in lattice systems. We find a relation between the induced topology and the Bell inequality's effectiveness in revealing nonlocal correlations.

For higher-dimensional systems, certain results for their two-level counterpart, like Bell violations with stabilizer states and Clifford operators, do not generalize. On the other hand, similar to continuous variable systems, Wigner negativity is necessary for nonlocality in qudit systems. We propose a family of Bell inequalities that inquire correlations related to the Wigner negativity of stabilizer states under the adjoint action of a generalization of the qubit $π/8$ gate, which, in the bipartite case, is an abstraction of the CHSH inequality. The classical bound is simple to compute, and a specified stabilizer state maximally violates the inequality among all qudit states based on the Wigner negativity and an inequality between the 1-norm and the maximum norm. The Bell operator not only serves as a measure for the singlet fraction but also quantifies the volume of Wigner negativity. Furthermore, we give deterministic Bell violations, as well as violations with a constant number of measurements, for the Bell state relying on operators innate to higher-dimensional systems than the qudit at hand.",{'stabilizer state': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Tensor Networks']

In this theory, superluminal propagation is allowed and there is a preferred timelike direction along the unit Aether vector field. If we choose the usual spherically symmetric background coordinates with respect to the Killing time $t$ and the areal radius $r$, it may not be appropriate for unambiguously determining the black hole stability because the constant $t$ hypersurfaces are not necessarily always spacelike. Unlike past related works of black hole perturbations, we choose an Aether-orthogonal frame in which the timelike Aether field is orthogonal to spacelike hypersurfaces over the whole background spacetime. In the short wavelength limit, we show that no-ghost conditions as well as radial and angular propagation speeds coincide with those of vector and tensor perturbations on the Minkowski background. Thus, the odd-parity linear stability of black holes for large radial and angular momentum modes is solely determined by constant coefficients of the Aether derivative couplings.",{'black holes': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

When the dynamics obeys a continuous symmetry, the entangling phase further splits into a fuzzy phase and a sharp phase based on the scaling of fluctuations of the symmetry charge. While the sharpening transition for Abelian symmetries is well understood analytically, no such understanding exists for the non- Abelian case. In this work, building on a recent analytical solution of the MIPT on tree-like circuit architectures (where qubits are repatedly added or removed from the system in a recursive pattern), we study entanglement and sharpening transitions in monitored dynamical quantum trees obeying U (1) and SU (2) symmetries. The recursive structure of tree tensor networks enables powerful analytical and numerical methods to determine the phase diagrams in both cases. In the U (1) case, we analytically derive a Fisher-KPP-like differential equation that allows us to locate the critical point and identify its properties. We find that the entanglement/purification and sharpening transitions generically occur at distinct measurement rates. In the SU (2) case, we find that the fuzzy phase is generic, and a sharp phase is possible only in the limit of maximal measurement rate.

We simulate accretion on a non-spinning SMBH ($a_*=0$) using initial conditions from a large scale galaxy simulation, and achieve steady state over 8 decades in radius. The density scales with radius as $ρ\propto r^{-1}$ inside the Bondi radius $R_B$, which is located at $R_B=2\times 10^5 \,r_g$ ($\approx 60\,{\rm pc}$ for M87) where $r_g$ is the gravitational radius of the SMBH; the plasma-$β\sim$ unity, indicating an extended magnetically arrested state; the mass accretion rate $\dot{M}$ is $\approx 1\%$ of the analytical Bondi accretion rate $\dot{M}_B$; and there is continuous energy feedback out to $\approx 100R_B$ (or beyond $>\,{\rm kpc}$) at a rate $\approx 0.02 \dot{M}c^2$. Surprisingly, any ordered rotation in the external medium does not survive as the magnetized gas flows to smaller radii, and the final steady solution is very similar to when the exterior has no rotation. Using the multi-zone method, we simulate GRMHD accretion for a wide range of Bondi radii, $R_{\rm B} \sim 10^2 - 10^7\,r_{\rm g}$, and find that $\dot{M}/\dot{M}_B\approx (R_B/6\, r_g)^{-0.5}$.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We find the solution of the radial equation of the Kerr metric and found the expression of the angular momentum per unit mass squared, $\tilde a = \frac{a}{M}$. We showed the profile of $\tilde a$ as a function of $\frac{r}{M}$. The solution also leads the energy per unit rest mass ($e$) and we showed its behavior as a function of $\frac{r}{M}$.

Accurate prediction of quantum Hamiltonian dynamics and identification of Hamiltonian parameters are crucial for advancements in quantum simulations, error correction, and control protocols. This study introduces a machine learning model with dual capabilities: it can deduce time-dependent Hamiltonian parameters from observed changes in local observables within quantum many-body systems, and it can predict the evolution of these observables based on Hamiltonian parameters. Our model's validity was confirmed through theoretical simulations across various scenarios and further validated by two experiments. Initially, the model was applied to a Nuclear Magnetic Resonance quantum computer, where it accurately predicted the dynamics of local observables.

However, most existing QNN models focus on the architectures of quantum recurrent neural network (QRNN) and self-attention mechanism (QSAM). In this work, we propose a novel QNN model based on quantum convolution. We develop the quantum depthwise convolution that significantly reduces the number of parameters and lowers computational complexity. We also introduce the multi-scale feature fusion mechanism to enhance model performance by integrating word-level and sentence-level features. Additionally, we propose the quantum word embedding and quantum sentence embedding, which provide embedding vectors more efficiently. Through experiments on two benchmark text classification datasets, we demonstrate our model outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art QNN models. Notably, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art test accuracy of 96.77% on the RP dataset.

Backreaction from quantum fluxes at the Kerr inner horizon,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13221v1,Tyler McMaken,"Black holes modeled by the Kerr metric are not semiclassically self-consistent at or below the inner horizon. The renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) of a scalar quantum field in the Unruh state has been found to diverge at the Kerr inner horizon, causing the geometry to backreact in a non-trivial way. In an effort to understand this backreaction, here the inner-horizon RSET is computed for the full physically relevant parameter space of black hole spins $a$ and polar angles $θ$. Then, the backreaction is analyzed using a framework for the dynamical behavior of mass inflation from continued accretion. It is shown that the initial backreaction from the RSET does not evolve the spacetime toward any known regular or extremal configuration, but instead it brings the local interior geometry toward a chaotic, spacelike singularity, classically stable over astrophysical timescales.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13150v1,"Denjoe O'Connor, Sanjaye Ramgoolam","We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature.

Memory Burden Effect in Black Holes and Solitons: Implications for PBH,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13117v1,"Gia Dvali, Juan Sebastián Valbuena-Bermúdez, Michael Zantedeschi","The essence of the \textit{memory burden} effect is that a load of information carried by a system stabilizes it. This universal effect is especially prominent in systems with a high capacity of information storage, such as black holes and other objects with maximal microstate degeneracy, the entities universally referred to as \textit{saturons}. The phenomenon has several implications. The memory burden effect suppresses a further decay of a black hole, the latest, after it has emitted about half of its initial mass. As a consequence, the light primordial black holes (PBHs), that previously were assumed to be fully evaporated, are expected to be present as viable dark matter candidates. In the present paper, we deepen the understanding of the memory burden effect. We first identify various memory burden regimes in generic Hamiltonian systems and then establish a precise correspondence in solitons and in black holes. We make transparent, at a microscopic level, the fundamental differences between the stabilization by a quantum memory burden versus the stabilization by a long-range classical hair due to a spin or an electric charge.

Possible Supercritical Accretion on the ULX in the Metal-poor Galaxy IZw18,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.13107v1,"Marina Yoshimoto, Tomokage Yoneyama, Hirofumi Noda, Hirokazu Odaka, Hironori Matsumoto","We present an analysis of X-ray observations of the Ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in IZw18 based on archival data taken with Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku. This ULX is considered to be an intermediate-mass black hole candidate simply because it is in the lowest metallicity environment among ULXs, where formation of heavy black holes is facilitated. However, actual study of the ULX based on observations spanning for a long period has been too limited to determine its nature. In this study, we investigate the spectral evolution of the ULX up to 2014, combining the previously-unpublished Suzaku data with those from the other two satellites. We derive a positive correlation of $L\propto T_{\rm in}^{2.1\pm0.4}$ between the bolometric luminosity $L$ and inner-disk temperature $T_{\rm in}$ on the basis of the multi-color disk-blackbody model, where we exclude the Chandra data, which has the lowest luminosity and systematic residuals in the fitting. The nominal relation $L\propto T_{\rm in}^{4}$ for the standard disk is rejected at a significance level of 1.5 %. These results suggest that the ULX was in the slim-disk state during these observations except at the time of the Chandra observation, in which the ULX was likely to be in a different state. The apparent inner-disk radius appears negatively correlated with the inner-disk temperature. Moreover, we find a radial dependence of the disk temperature of $T (r)\propto r^{-p}$ with $p<0.75$, which also supports the hypothesis that the ULX has a slim disk. In consequence, the IZw18 ULX is most likely to be powered by a stellar-mass compact object in supercritical accretion.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We find that in the thin disk accretion model the location and the emitted model of the accretion gas affect on the optical appearance of charged Einstein-Æther black holes in contrast to the spherical accretion flows. For a thin disk profile, we show that the observer will receive more intensity for an emitted model as Gaussian function when the innermost radiation radius lies in the innermost stable circular orbit.

It is expected that they correspond to an ensemble of pure, horizonless microstates sourced by localized versions of this brane system. This thesis aims at studying the relationship between supersymmetric black holes and their microstates. In particular, we apply a concept called local supersymmetry enhancement to 1/4-BPS and 1/8-BPS systems that correspond to two-, three-, and four-charge black holes. This concept locally increases the number of preserved supercharges to 16 by adding dipole charges to the system. These bound states are then expected to be horizonless and describe the microstates of the black hole. First, we list all dipole charges for 1/4-BPS systems in Type II string theory. Then, we apply these to generate two structures to enhance 1/8-BPS systems, one with exclusively internal dipole charges and the other with a non-trivial shape in the non-compact dimensions. Thus, we identify the dipole charges for the microstates of various supersymmetric black holes, including new internal dipole charges for the D1-D5-P black hole and external ones for the D2-D2-D2-D6 black hole.

Phase-space negativity as a computational resource for quantum kernel methods,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12378v1,"Ulysse Chabaud, Roohollah Ghobadi, Salman Beigi, Saleh Rahimi-Keshari","Quantum kernel methods are a proposal for achieving quantum computational advantage in machine learning. They are based on a hybrid classical-quantum computation where a function called the quantum kernel is estimated by a quantum device while the rest of the computation is performed classically. Quantum advantages may be achieved through this method only if the quantum kernel function cannot be estimated efficiently on a classical computer. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for the efficient classical estimation of quantum kernel functions for bosonic systems. Specifically, we show that if the negativity in the phase-space quasi-probability distributions of data-encoding quantum states associated with the quantum kernel scales at most polynomially with the size of the quantum circuit, then the kernel function can be estimated efficiently classically. We consider quantum optical examples involving linear-optical networks with and without adaptive non-Gaussian measurements and investigate the effects of loss on the efficiency of the classical simulation. Our results underpin the role of the negativity in phase-space quasi-probability distributions as an essential resource in quantum machine learning based on kernel methods.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'quantum machine learning': 1}",05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Glazebrook, Antonino Marciano","Topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) provide a general, minimal-assumption language for describing quantum-state preparation and measurement. They therefore provide a general language in which to express multi-agent communication protocols, e.g. local operations, classical communication (LOCC) protocols. In the accompanying Part I, we construct LOCC protocols using TQFT, and show that LOCC protocols induce quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) on the agent-environment boundary. Such QECCs can be regarded as implementing or inducing the emergence of spacetimes on such boundaries. Here we investigate this connection between inter-agent communication and spacetime, exploiting different realizations of TQFT. We delve into TQFTs that support on their boundaries spin-networks as computational systems: these are known as topological quantum neural networks (TQNNs). TQNNs, which have a natural representation as tensor networks, implement QECC. We recognize into the HaPPY code a paradigmatic example. We then show how generic QECCs, as bulk-boundary codes, induce effective spacetimes. The effective spatial and temporal separations that take place in QECC enables LOCC protocols between spatially separated observers. We then consider the implementation of QECCs in BF and Chern-Simons theories, and show that QECC-induced spacetimes provide the classical redundancy required for LOCC. Finally, we consider topological M-theory as an implementation of QECC in higher spacetime dimensions.",{'tensor networks': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Tensor Networks']

This reduction of parameters can speed up the learning process and reduce the use of computational resources. However, in the current phase of quantum computing development, known as the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era (NISQ), learning is difficult due to a limited number of qubits and widespread quantum noise. To overcome these challenges, researchers are focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQCs). VQCs are hybrid algorithms that merge a quantum circuit, which can be adjusted through parameters, with traditional classical optimization techniques. These circuits require only few qubits for effective learning. Recent studies have presented new ways of applying VQCs to reinforcement learning, showing promising results that warrant further exploration. This study investigates the effects of various techniques -- data re-uploading, input scaling, output scaling -- and introduces exponential learning rate decay in the quantum proximal policy optimization algorithm's actor-VQC. We assess these methods in the popular Frozen Lake and Cart Pole environments. Our focus is on their ability to reduce the number of parameters in the VQC without losing effectiveness. Our findings indicate that data re-uploading and an exponential learning rate decay significantly enhance hyperparameter stability and overall performance. While input scaling does not improve parameter efficiency, output scaling effectively manages greediness, leading to increased learning speed and robustness.",{'quantum circuit': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We analyze the circular orbits of vortices around the acoustic black hole and delve into the chaotic motion of the vortex at the unstable equilibrium in the vicinity of the horizon. Furthermore, we explore whether a universal bound exists for the Lyapunov exponent characterising this chaotic motion, drawing parallels to the known bounds for the particle motion in general relativity.

With an emphasis on the search for stellar-mass black holes and neutron stars hidden in binary systems, we start a broader effort to characterize the most promising candidates using follow-up ground-based observations. Accurate quantification of orbital and physical parameters of systems with dim or invisible companions requires combination of Hipparcos, Gaia, and precision spectroscopic measurements.

While the impact of strongly coupled non-local cavity modes on integer quantum Hall physics has been recently addressed, its effects on fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids -- and, more generally, fractionalized states of matter -- remain largely unexplored. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the understanding of FQH states coupled to quantum light. In particular, combining analytical arguments with tensor network simulations, we study the dynamics of a $ν=1/3$ Laughlin state in a single-mode cavity with finite electric field gradients. We find that the topological signatures of the FQH state remain robust against the non-local cavity vacuum fluctuations, as indicated by the endurance of the quantized Hall resistivity. The entanglement spectra, however, carry direct fingerprints of light-matter entanglement and topology, revealing peculiar polaritonic replicas of the $U(1)$ counting. As a further response to cavity fluctuations, we also find a squeezed FQH geometry, encoded in long-wavelength correlations. We additionally observe that moving to strong cavity field gradients leads to an instability towards a sliding Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid phase, featuring a strong density modulation in the gradient direction. Finally, by exploring the low-energy excited spectrum inside the FQH phase, we identify a new quasiparticle, the graviton-polariton, arising from the hybridization between quadrupolar FQH collective excitations (known as gravitons) and light.

This recovery does not require any \emph{ad hoc} parameter adjustments; it solely depends on the independently measured cosmic star formation rate density. We discuss our result in the context of the missing baryon problem and the anomalously low sum of neutrino masses preferred by DESI. The global evolution of DE is an orthogonal probe of cosmological coupling, complementing constraints on BH mass growth from elliptical galaxies, stellar binaries, globular clusters, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA merging population, and X-ray binaries.

Further, we propose that the universe's timescale for entropy production could be dynamically linked to black hole production in a naturally selected universe. Our universe would fit this scenario for models of particle dark matter that convert helium white dwarfs to black holes in around a hundred trillion years, where the dominant source of entropy in our universe are the helium white dwarfs' stellar progenitors, which cease forming and burning also in around a hundred trillion years.

The proof relies on solving an equation that looks like the equation for spacetime harmonic functions studied in [7], but with a Neumann boundary condition and non-zero right hand side, which we refer to as a spacetime Poisson equation. One advantage of this method of proof is that the conformal deformation is explicitly constructed as a solution to a PDE, as opposed to only knowing the solution exists via an application of the implicit function theorem as in [16].

It is found that there are interesting critical phenomena and phase behaviors in the (grand) canonical ensembles of fixed (Q, V, C), (Φ, V, C) and (Q, V, μ). When the other parameters are fixed, the free energy increases with the global monopole increases. In (Q, V, C) ensemble, the range of unstable region increases with the increase of global monopole. In (Φ, V, C) ensemble, when Φ < Φc, the free energy appears two branches, the upper and lower branches correspond to low entropy and high entropy respectively. When (Q, V, μ) is fixed, a new zero-order phase transition occurs in the high-entropy phase and the low-entropy phase at certain μ-dependent temperatures. When μ increases to a certain value, this zero-order phase transition disappears. This certain value is positively related to the magnitude of the global monopole. Finally, we find that p-V criticality does not appear with the change of global monopole. Therefore, it is important to note that the CFT states of charged black holes with global monopole do not correspond to Van der Waals fluids. Finally, we find that charged black holes with global monopoles can better reflect thermodynamic phase transitions and critical phenomena under the AdS/CFT correspondence. By adjusting the change of the global monopole, the thermodynamic phase transition will also change.","{'AdS/CFT': 2, 'black holes': 2}",05.2024,2024,05,"['Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"

Feedback-regulated Seed Black Hole Growth in Star-Forming Molecular Clouds and Galactic Nuclei,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12164v1,"Yanlong Shi, Kyle Kremer, Philip F. Hopkins","The detection of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift luminous quasars may require a phase of rapid accretion, and as a precondition, substantial gas influx toward seed black holes (BHs) from kilo-parsec or parsec scales. Our previous research demonstrated the plausibility of such gas supply for BH seeds within star-forming giant molecular clouds (GMCs) with high surface density ($\sim 10^4\,{\rm {\rm M_\odot}\, pc}^{-2}$), facilitating ``hyper-Eddington'' accretion via efficient feeding by dense clumps which are driven by turbulence and stellar feedback. This article investigates the impacts of feedback from accreting BHs on this process, including radiation, mechanical jets, and highly relativistic cosmic rays. We run a suite of numerical simulations to explore diverse parameter spaces of BH feedback, including the sub-grid accretion model, feedback energy efficiency, mass loading factor, and initial metallicity. Utilizing radiative feedback models inferred from the slim disk, we find that hyper-Eddington accretion is still achievable, yielding BH bolometric luminosities as high as $10^{41}$ -- $10^{44}\,\rm erg/s$, depending on the GMC properties and specific feedback model assumed. We find the maximum possible mass growth of seed BHs ($ΔM_{\rm BH}^{\rm max}$) is regulated by the momentum deposition rate from BH feedback, $\dot{p}_{\rm feedback}/(\dot{M}_{\rm BH} c)$, which leads to an analytic scaling that agrees well with simulations. This scenario predicts the rapid formation of $\sim 10^4\,\rm M_\odot$ intermediate-massive BHs (IMBHs) from stellar-mass BHs within $\sim \rm Myr$. Furthermore, we examine the impacts of sub-grid accretion models and how BH feedback may influence star formation within these cloud complexes.",{'black holes': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Generating large primordial fluctuations in single-field inflation for PBH formation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.12149v2,"Jason Kristiano, Jun'ichi Yokoyama","In order to produce appreciable amount of primordial black holes (PBHs), the square amplitude of curvature perturbation must take a large value of $\mathcal{O}(0.01)$, namely, seven digits larger than the value observed by cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) on large scales. Such a large fluctuation can be achieved by violating the slow-roll (SR) condition within a short duration. The best known of such possibilities is the ultraslow-roll (USR) inflation. We calculate the power spectrum of curvature perturbation in a simple single-field inflation model which evolves through the SR-USR-SR regimes so that both large-amplitude small-scale fluctuation for PBH formation and small-amplitude large-scale fluctuation as observed by CMB are realized. We further calculate the bispectrum and one-loop correction to the power spectrum induced by the third-order action of curvature perturbation as the beginning of precision cosmology on small scales.

This study aims to identify the optimal conditions for stellar collisions across a range of stellar systems leading to the formation of very massive stars that subsequently collapse into black holes. We analyze data from numerical simulations and observations of diverse stellar systems, encompassing various initial conditions, initial mass functions, and evolution scenarios. We computed a critical mass, determined by the interplay of collision time, system age, and initial properties of the star cluster. The efficiency of black hole formation ($ε_{\mathrm{BH}}$) is defined as the ratio of initial stellar mass divided by critical mass. We find that stellar systems with a ratio of initial stellar mass over critical mass above 1 exhibit a high efficiencies in terms of black hole formation, ranging from $30-100\%$. While there is some scatter, potentially attributed to complex system histories and the presence of gas, the results highlight the potential for achieving high efficiencies via a purely collisional channel in black hole formation. In conclusion, this theoretical exploration elucidates the connection between star clusters and black hole formation.

It has opened up an exciting new window for laboratory and space tests of Einstein's theory of classical general relativity. In recent years there are two interesting proposals aimed at revealing the quantum natures of perturbative gravity: 1) theoretical predictions in how graviton noise from the early universe after the vacuum of the gravitational field was strongly squeezed by inflationary expansion; 2) experimental proposals using the quantum entanglement between two masses each in a superposition state. The first proposal invokes the stochastic properties of quantum fields, the second invokes a key concept of quantum information. An equally basic and interesting idea is to ask whether and how gravity might be responsible for a quantum system becoming classical in appearance, known as gravitational decoherence. Decoherence due to gravity is of special interest because gravity is universal. This is an important issue in macroscopic quantum phenomena. To fully appreciate these exciting developments requires a working knowledge in classical GR, QF theory and QI plus some familiarity with stochastic processes, namely, noise in quantum fields.

Magnetized Accretion onto and Feedback from Supermassive Black Holes in Elliptical Galaxies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11711v1,"Minghao Guo, James M. Stone, Eliot Quataert, Chang-Goo Kim","We present three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the fueling of supermassive black holes in elliptical galaxies from a turbulent cooling medium on galactic scales, taking M87* as a typical case. We find that the mass accretion rate is increased by a factor of $\sim 10$ compared with analogous hydrodynamic simulations. The scaling of $\dot{M} \sim r^{1/2}$ roughly holds from $\sim 10\,\mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($\sim 10\, r_\mathrm{g}$) with the accretion rate through the event horizon being $\sim 10^{-2}\, M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$. The accretion flow on scales $\sim 0.03-3\,\mathrm{kpc}$ takes the form of magnetized filaments. Within $\sim 30\,\mathrm{pc}$, the cold gas circularizes, forming a highly magnetized ($β\sim 10^{-3}$) thick disk supported by a primarily toroidal magnetic field. The cold disk is truncated and transitions to a turbulent hot accretion flow at $\sim0.3\,\mathrm{pc}$ ($10^3\,r_\mathrm{g}$). There are strong outflows towards the poles driven by the magnetic field. The outflow energy flux increases with smaller accretor size, reaching $\sim 3\times10^{43}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for $r_\mathrm{in}=8\,r_\mathrm{g}$; this corresponds to a nearly constant energy feedback efficiency of $η\sim0.05-0.1$ independent of accretor size. The feedback energy is enough to balance the total cooling of the M87/Virgo hot halo out to $\sim 50$ kpc. The accreted magnetic flux at small radii is similar to that in magnetically arrested disk models, consistent with the formation of a powerful jet on horizon scales in M87.

QuAN directly learns the growth in entanglement and state complexity from experimentally obtained computational basis measurements. In particular, it learns the growth in complexity of random circuit data upon increasing depth from noisy experimental data. Taken to a regime inaccessible by existing theory, QuAN unveils the complete phase diagram for noisy toric code data as a function of both noise types.

Possible influence of a cosmic repulsion on large-scale jets: geometric viewpoint,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11587v1,Petr Slaný,"Cosmic repulsion represented by a small positive value of the cosmological constant changes significantly properties of central gravitational fields at large distances, leading to existence of a static (or turnaround) radius where gravitational attraction of a center is just balanced by cosmic repulsion. Analyzing behavior of radial timelike geodesics in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime near its static radius we show that the particles with specific energy close to unity have tendency to slow down and cluster just below the static radius, forming clumps which, subsequently, start to expand uniformly due to cosmic repulsion. For central masses of $(10^6$-$10^{11}){\rm M_{\odot}}$ and current value of the cosmological constant $1.1\times 10^{-52}\,{\rm m^{-2}}$, this phenomenon takes place at distances of tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs from the center, being comparable with distances in which huge radio-lobes from some active galaxies were observed.",{'geodesics': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We obtain the exact wormhole solutions with anisotropic matter source based on the Bose-Einstein condensate, Navarro-Frenk-White, and pseudo-isothermal matter density profiles. Notably, we present a novel wormhole solution supported by these dark matters using the expressions for the density profile and rotational velocity along with the modified field equations to calculate the redshift and shape functions of the wormholes. With a particular set of parameters, we demonstrate that our proposed wormhole solutions fulfill the flare-out condition against an asymptotic background. Additionally, we examine the energy conditions, focusing on the null energy conditions at the wormhole's throat, providing a graphical representation of the feasible and negative regions. Our study also examines the wormhole's shadow in the presence of various dark matter models, revealing that higher central densities result in a shadow closer to the throat, whereas lower values have the opposite effect. Moreover, we explore the deflection of light when it encounters these wormholes, particularly noting that light deflection approaches infinity at the throat, where the gravitational field is extremely strong.",{'traversable wormhole': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

To this end, our paper covers, on the one hand, a comprehensive introduction to the physical foundations and mechanisms that play an important role in operating a trapped-ion quantum computer. On the other hand, we provide an overview of the key performance metrics that best describe and characterise such a device's current computing capability. These metrics encompass performance indicators such as qubit numbers, gate times and errors, native gate sets, qubit stability and scalability as well as considerations regarding the general qubit types and trap architectures. In order to ensure that these metrics reflect the current state of trapped-ion quantum computing as accurate as possible, they have been obtained by both an extensive review of recent literature and, more importantly, from discussions with various quantum hardware vendors in the field. We combine these factors and provide - again from an industrial end-user perspective - an overview of what is currently possible with trapped-ion quantum computers, which algorithms and problems are especially suitable for this platform, what are the relevant end-to-end wall clock times for calculations, and what might be possible with future fault-tolerant trapped-ion quantum computers.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Disturbance Evaluation Circuit in Quantum Measurement,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11447v1,"Haruki Emori, Masanao Ozawa, Akihisa Tomita","According to the uncertainty principle, every quantum measurement accompanies disturbance. In particular, accurate sequential measurements need the accurate control of disturbance. However, the correct role of disturbance in the uncertainty principle has been known only recently. Understanding the disturbance is crucial for understanding the fundamentals of physics, and accurately evaluating the disturbance is important for quantum technologies such as quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Therefore, the experimental evaluation of the disturbance is a significant challenge in those fields. In this study, we propose a novel evaluation method for the quantum root-mean-square (QRMS) disturbance and compare its performance with the existing approaches, known as the three-state method (TSM) and the weak measurement method (WMM). Our method establishes a correspondence between the QRMS disturbance of the measurement and the second-order derivative of the decoherence induced in a newly introduced weak probe system with respect to the coupling strength of the weak interaction at its zero-limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in comparison with the other two through a simulation and experiment using a quantum computer.

We first present an algorithm based on QRS that prepares a quantum state $|ψ_f\rangle \propto \sum^N_{x=1} f(x)|x\rangle$. When combined with efficient reference states the algorithm reduces the cost of quantum state preparation substantially, if certain criteria on $f$ are met. When the preparation of the reference state is not the dominant cost, and the function $f$ and relevant properties are efficiently computable or provided otherwise with cost $o(N)$, the QRS-based method outperforms the generic state preparation algorithm, which has cost $O(N)$. We demonstrate the detailed performance (in terms of the number of Toffoli gates) of the QRS-based algorithm for quantum states commonly appearing in quantum applications, e.g., those with coefficients that obey power law decay, Gaussian, and hyperbolic tangent, and compare it with other methods. Then, we adapt QRS techniques to the matrix block-encoding problem and introduce a QRS-based algorithm for block-encoding a given matrix $A = \sum_{ij} A_{ij} |i\rangle \langle j|$. We work out rescaling factors for different access models, which encode how the information about the matrix is provided to the quantum computer. We exemplify these results for a particular Toeplitz matrix with elements $A_{\mathbf{ij}}= 1/\|{\mathbf{i}}-{\mathbf{j}}\|^2$, which appears in quantum chemistry, and PDE applications, e.g., when the Coulomb interaction is involved. Our work unifies, and in certain ways goes beyond, various quantum state preparation and matrix block-encoding methods in the literature, and gives detailed performance analysis of important examples that appear in quantum applications.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
How do Primordial Black Holes change the Halo Mass Function and Structure?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11381v1,"Saiyang Zhang, Volker Bromm, Boyuan Liu","We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $Λ$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $Λ$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

In this study, we investigate how higher harmonics affect luminosity distance estimation for third-generation (3G) GW detectors in binary black hole mergers. Our findings demonstrate that considering higher harmonics significantly enhances distance inference results compared with using only the (2,2) mode. This improved accuracy in distance estimates also strengthens constraints on host galaxies, enabling more precise measurements of the Hubble constant.

QuaLITi: Quantum Machine Learning Hardware Selection for Inferencing with Top-Tier Performance,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.11194v1,"Koustubh Phalak, Swaroop Ghosh","Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is an accelerating field of study that leverages the principles of quantum computing to enhance and innovate within machine learning methodologies. However, Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers suffer from noise that corrupts the quantum states of the qubits and affects the training and inferencing accuracy. Furthermore, quantum computers have long access queues. A single execution with a pre-defined number of shots can take hours just to reach the top of the wait queue, which is especially disadvantageous to Quantum Machine Learning (QML) algorithms that are iterative in nature. Many vendors provide access to a suite of quantum hardware with varied qubit technologies, number of qubits, coupling architectures, and noise characteristics. However, present QML algorithms do not use them for the training procedure and often rely on local noiseless/noisy simulators due to cost and training timing overhead on real hardware. Additionally, inferencing is generally performed on reduced datasets with fewer datapoints. Taking these constraints into account, we perform a study to maximize the inferencing performance of QML workloads based on the choice of hardware selection. Specifically, we perform a detailed analysis of quantum classifiers (both training and inference through the lens of hardware queue wait times) on Iris and reduced Digits datasets under noise and varied conditions such as different hardware and coupling maps. We show that using multiple readily available hardware for training rather than relying on a single hardware, especially if it has a long queue depth of pending jobs, can lead to a performance impact of only 3-4% while providing up to 45X reduction in training wait time.",{'quantum machine learning': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The key insight of the approach is that all rotationally invariant functions with vector inputs are equivalent to a function with inputs of vector inner products.

Just as the coadjoint element, $A$, is related to a gauge fixed Yang-Mills vector potential $A_a$, the diffeomorphism field, $\mathcal{D}$, is related to a component, $\mathcal{D}_{a b}$ of the projectively invariant connection called the Thomas Operator. The Yang-Mills action provides dynamics for the vector potential $A_a,$ while the Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravitational action, provides dynamics to $\mathcal{D}_{ab}$. The TW action embeds the projectively invariant connection into a gravitational theory that contains general relativity. In this work, the diffeomorphism field $\mathcal{D}_{a b}$ is examined in Minkowski space where salient features of this field can be explored. In particular, we study the radiative degrees of freedom of this field while in a Minkowski space background. We show that it can be decomposed into irreducible representations, corresponding to tensor, vector, and scalar radiating solutions.

Our analysis follows the general strategy developed by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos for the perturbations of the Reissner-Nordström black hole. Here, the analysis is considerably more involved, because of the presence of the dilaton field, which couples to the other polar modes.

If an ejected SMBH retains its inner accretion disk, it may be visible as an off-nuclear active galactic nucleus (AGN). At present, only a handful of offset AGNs that are recoil or slingshot candidates have been found, and none have been robustly confirmed. Compiling a large sample of runaway SMBHs would enable us to constrain the mass and spin evolution of binary SMBHs and study feedback effects of displaced AGNs. We adapt the method of varstrometry -- which was developed for Gaia observations to identify off-center, dual, and lensed AGNs -- in order to quickly identify off-nuclear AGNs in optical survey data by looking for an excess of blue versus red astrometric jitter. We apply this to the Pan-STARRS1 3pi Survey and report on five new runaway AGN candidates. We focus on ZTF18aajyzfv: a luminous quasar offset by 6.7 $\pm$ 0.2 kpc from an adjacent galaxy at $z$=0.224, and conclude after Keck LRIS spectroscopy and comparison to ASTRID simulation analogs that it is likely a dual AGN. This selection method can be easily adapted to work with data from the soon-to-be commissioned Vera C. Rubin Telescope Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST).

A particular challenge associated with VQAs is understanding the properties of associated cost functions. Having the landscapes of VQA cost functions can greatly assist in developing and testing new variational quantum algorithms, but they are extremely expensive to compute. Reconstructing the landscape of a VQA using existing techniques requires a large number of cost function evaluations, especially when the dimension or the resolution of the landscape is high. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank tensor-completion-based approach for local landscape reconstruction.

In the de Sitter spacetime, a cosmological horizon that constrains the causal accessible region of an observer, exhibits thermal properties analogous to the event horizon of a black hole. From the principle of holography, the entropy within the causally connected region for an observer is constrained by the area of its boundary. This entropy bound is violated in the late stage of inflation. To address the issue of entropy bound violation from a perspective of quantum information, we adopt the stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. To reformulate the issue of entropy bound in the inflation, we follow the derivation of the Page curve in the black hole context.

Dynamics of Heavy Operators in $AdS/CFT$,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10784v1,Aryaman Mishra,"The correlation function in Ads/CFT are correlation of the operator insertions on the boundary (at CFT) through the complete geometry of bulk. These are represented by Witten diagrams which at tree level doesn't have any quantum corrections. Generally, correlation functions are of low scaling (or conformal) dimension, $Δ$, which is related to the mass of insertion of the scalar operator by, $Δ(Δ- 1) = m^2 L_{AdS}^2$. At low scaling dimensions the operator insertion on the CFT boundary does not back-react the metric of the geometry. On the other hand, at large scaling dimensions which scale with central charge the operator is considered heavy. This leads to an interesting question of what in the dual bulk (AdS) geometry of such heavy operators. At the heavy limit $Δ= m L_{AdS}$, which means that the mass of the operator insertion is large too. The two-point function of heavy-operator is assumed to be Black hole in $(d+1)$-dimensions and the two-point form of CFT is recovered by calculating the action. In $3$-dimension we have more control over the geometry because of existence of exact metric called Bañados metric with boundary stress-tensor insertion along with a map which maps it to Euclidean Poincare upper half plane. These methods are used to find the geometry for three-point function. The geometry is not simply of a black-hole but a wormhole solution for whose action is calculated which recovers the ""square"" of the classical DOZZ formula.

We include 72 quasars with black hole masses estimated from velocity-broadened emission-line measurements and single-epoch virial prescriptions in the footprint of a highly complete parent survey. The sample mean Eddington ratio and standard deviation is $\logλ\approx -0.20\pm0.24$. The completeness-corrected mass function is modelled as a double power-law, and we constrain its evolution across redshift assuming accretion-dominated mass growth. We estimate the evolution of the mass function from $z=5-4$, presenting joint constraints on accretion properties through a measured dimensionless e-folding parameter, $k_{\rm{ef}} \equiv \langleλ\rangle U (1-ε)/ε= 1.79\pm0.06$, where $\langleλ\rangle$ is the mean Eddington ratio, $U$ is the duty cycle, and $ε$ is the radiative efficiency. If these supermassive black holes were to form from seeds smaller than $10^8\,M_{\odot}$, the growth rate must have been considerably faster at $z\gg5$ than observed from $z=5-4$. A growth rate exceeding $3\times$ the observed rate would reduce the initial heavy seed mass to $10^{5-6}\,M_{\odot}$, aligning with supermassive star and/or direct collapse seed masses. Stellar mass ($10^2\,M_{\odot}$) black hole seeds would require $\gtrsim4.5\times$ the observed growth rate at $z\gg5$ to reproduce the measured active black hole mass function.

Through the identification of a characteristic time scale for the CL phenomenon, it was observed that larger SMBHs possess shorter characteristic timescales, while smaller SMBHs exhibit longer timescales. These findings reveal a significant contrast to the traditional AGN variability that has been adequately explained by the AGN's disk instability model. This stark discrepancy highlights a distinct origin of the CL phenomenon, distinguishing it from traditional AGN variability. By properly predicting the characteristic time scale and its dependence on SMBH mass, we propose that the CL phenomenon is likely a result of a variation in accretion rate caused by a sudden change in the supply of circumnuclear gas during the transition between active and passive SMBH fueling stages.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

In our model, the $B-L$ Higgs field is identified with the inflaton and the electroweak symmetry breaking is triggered by the radiative $B-L$ symmetry breaking with the Coleman-Weinberg potential. We show that this UV completion leads to a viable cosmological history after the double inflaton: the universe is reheated via inflaton decay into right-handed neutrinos whose mass is determined consistently by a relation between the number of e-folds and reheating temperature. Using the general parameterization for neutrino Dirac Yukawa couplings through the seesaw mechanism and the neutrino oscillation data, we also show that the observed baryon asymmetry of the universe is successfully reproduced by either resonant leptogenesis or non-thermal leptogenesis.

Despite significant progress towards building a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC), there is still a need for resource-efficient quantum simulators. Here, we propose a hybrid simulator that enables classical computers to leverage FTQC devices and quantum time propagators to overcome this bottleneck, so as to efficiently simulate the quantum dynamics of large systems initialized in an unknown superposition of a few system eigenstates. It features no optimization subroutines and avoids barren plateau issues, while consuming fewer quantum resources compared to standard methods when many time steps are required.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Exponential improvements in the simulation of lattice gauge theories using near-optimal techniques,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10416v1,"Mason Rhodes, Michael Kreshchuk, Shivesh Pathak","Simulation of quantum systems of a large number of strongly interacting particles persists as one of the most challenging, and computationally demanding, tasks in classical simulation, involving both non-relativistic applications like condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, as well as relativistic applications like lattice gauge theory simulation. One of the major motivations for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer is the efficient simulation of many-body systems on such a device. While significant developments have been made in the quantum simulation of non-relativistic systems, the simulation of lattice gauge theories has lagged behind, with state-of-the-art Trotterized simulations requiring many orders of magnitude more resources than non-relativistic simulation, in stark contrast to the similar difficulty of these tasks in classical simulation. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the cost of simulating Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in the Kogut-Susskind formulation using simulation methods with near-optimal scaling in system size, evolution time, and error. We provide explicit circuit constructions, as well as T-gate counts and qubit counts for the entire simulation algorithm. This investigation, the first of its kind, leads to up to 25 orders of magnitude improvement over Trotterization in spacetime volume for non-Abelian simulations. Such a dramatic improvement results largely from our algorithm having polynomial scaling with the number of colors, as opposed to exponential scaling in existing approaches. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced algorithmic techniques leads to dramatic reductions in the cost of ab initio simulations of fundamental interactions, bringing it in step with resources required for first principles quantum simulation of chemistry and condensed matter physics.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Primordial black holes captured by neutron stars: simulations in general relativity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10365v1,"Thomas W. Baumgarte, Stuart L. Shapiro","We present self-consistent numerical simulations in general relativity of putative primordial black holes inside neutron stars. Complementing a companion paper in which we assumed the black hole mass $m$ to be much smaller than the mass $M_*$ of the neutron star, thereby justifying a point-mass treatment, we here consider black holes with masses large enough so that their effect on the neutron star cannot be neglected. We develop and employ several new numerical techniques, including initial data describing boosted black holes in neutron-star spacetimes, a relativistic determination of the escape speed, and a gauge condition that keeps the black hole hole at a fixed coordinate location. We then perform numerical simulations that highlight different aspects of the capture of primordial black holes by neutron stars. In particular, we simulate the initial passage of the black hole through the star, demonstrating that the neutron star remains dynamically stable provided the black-hole mass is sufficiently small, $m \lesssim 0.05 M_*$. We also model the late evolution of a black hole oscillating about the center of an initially stable neutron star while accreting stellar mass and ultimately triggering gravitational collapse.",{'black holes': 4},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently quantum chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice.

In this context Cauchy horizons do not appear in the maximal analytical extension once an event horizon is formed so that the interior spacetime does not suffer from any sort of instabilities which are well known in the literature. On the contrary, the causal structure exhibits an event horizon -- encapsulating a spacelike singularity -- and a cosmological horizon. We show that the strong cosmic censorship is then restored for a wide range of the parameters including configurations in which the black hole charge is much larger than its mass.

The fermion doubling problem is circumvented by constructing a Fock space endowed with a semi-definite norm. When projecting our theory on the the single-particle sector, we recover the framework of Stacey fermions, and we demonstrate that the scaling limit of the free model recovers the chiral fermion field. Technically, we make use of a matrix product operator norm to mimick the boundary of a higher dimensional topological theory. As a proof of principle, we consider a single Weyl fermion on a periodic ring with Hubbard-type nearest-neighbor interactions and construct a variational generalized DMRG code to demonstrate that the ground state for large system sizes can be determined efficiently.

Using a new hyperboloidal framework, we resolve the discrepancy by showing that the QQNM/QNM ratio is a function not only of the black hole parameters but also of the ratio between even- and odd-parity linear QNMs: the ratio QQNM/QNM depends on what created the ringing black hole, but only through this ratio of even- to odd-parity linear perturbations.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Quantum State Learning Implies Circuit Lower Bounds,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10242v1,"Nai-Hui Chia, Daniel Liang, Fang Song","We establish connections between state tomography, pseudorandomness, quantum state synthesis, and circuit lower bounds. In particular, let $\mathfrak{C}$ be a family of non-uniform quantum circuits of polynomial size and suppose that there exists an algorithm that, given copies of $|ψ\rangle$, distinguishes whether $|ψ\rangle$ is produced by $\mathfrak{C}$ or is Haar random, promised one of these is the case. For arbitrary fixed constant $c$, we show that if the algorithm uses at most $O(2^{n^c})$ time and $2^{n^{0.99}}$ samples then $\mathsf{stateBQE} \not\subset \mathsf{state}\mathfrak{C}$. Here $\mathsf{stateBQE} := \mathsf{stateBQTIME}[2^{O(n)}]$ and $\mathsf{state}\mathfrak{C}$ are state synthesis complexity classes as introduced by Rosenthal and Yuen (ITCS 2022), which capture problems with classical inputs but quantum output. Note that efficient tomography implies a similarly efficient distinguishing algorithm against Haar random states, even for nearly exponential-time algorithms. Because every state produced by a polynomial-size circuit can be learned with $2^{O(n)}$ samples and time, or $O(n^{ω(1)})$ samples and $2^{O(n^{ω(1)})}$ time, we show that even slightly non-trivial quantum state tomography algorithms would lead to new statements about quantum state synthesis. Finally, a slight modification of our proof shows that distinguishing algorithms for quantum states can imply circuit lower bounds for decision problems as well. This help sheds light on why time-efficient tomography algorithms for non-uniform quantum circuit classes has only had limited and partial progress. Our work parallels results by Arunachalam et al. (FOCS 2021) that revealed a similar connection between quantum learning of Boolean functions and circuit lower bounds for classical circuit classes, but modified for the purposes of state tomography and state synthesis.",{'quantum circuit': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

A notable difference from previous works lies in the presence of the $γ_0 γ_+$ matrix in $T_{++}$, causing a loss of symmetry. This challenge is addressed by making use of its square-root matrix.

Mergers of hairy black holes: Constraining topological couplings from entropy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10127v1,"Kabir Chakravarti, Amit Reza, Leonardo G.

The presence of scalar hair is reflected non-trivially in the entropy of the black hole along with any topological coupling that may be present in the action. Demanding that a system of two merging black holes obeys the global second law of thermodynamics imposes a bound on this topological coupling coefficient. In this work we study how this bound is pushed from its GR value by the presence of scalar hair by considering estimates of binary black-hole merger parameters through inference studies of mock gravitational-wave (GW) events. We find that the scalar charge may produce a statistically significant deviation of the change in entropy over the GR prediction. However, we also find the latter is susceptible to biases arising out of GW inferences which ends up being two orders of magnitude larger, therefore overwhelming any change induced by the scalar hair.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
A Recursive Lower Bound on the Energy Improvement of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.10125v1,"Raimel A. Medina, Maksym Serbyn","The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) uses a quantum computer to implement a variational method with $2p$ layers of alternating unitary operators, optimized by a classical computer to minimize a cost function. While rigorous performance guarantees exist for the QAOA at small depths $p$, the behavior at large depths remains less clear, though simulations suggest exponentially fast convergence for certain problems. In this work, we gain insights into the deep QAOA using an analytic expansion of the cost function around transition states. Transition states are constructed in a recursive manner: from the local minima of the QAOA with $p$ layers we obtain transition states of the QAOA with $p+1$ layers, which are stationary points characterized by a unique direction of negative curvature. We construct an analytic estimate of the negative curvature and the corresponding direction in parameter space at each transition state. The expansion of the QAOA cost function along the negative direction to the quartic order gives a lower bound of the QAOA cost function improvement. We provide physical intuition behind the analytic expressions for the local curvature and quartic expansion coefficient. Our numerical study confirms the accuracy of our approximations and reveals that the obtained bound and the true value of the QAOA cost function gain have a characteristic exponential decrease with the number of layers $p$, with the bound decreasing more rapidly. Our study establishes an analytical method for recursively studying the QAOA that is applicable in the regime of high circuit depth.",{'quantum computer': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The generalized Plebański-Demiański solutions are black hole-like spacetimes characterized by seven physical parameters. Most of the black holes in four dimensions are included within this family. Generically consider a solution with horizon in this family, we figure out the possible warped conformal symmetry attached to the horizon. The horizon can be either extremal or non-extremal. In the extremal case, the near horizon region can be mapped to an infinite spacetime with geometry given by a warped and twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$. The new boundary conditions for AdS$_2$ as well as their higher dimensional uplifts are applied here to manifest the asymptotic symmetry as the warped conformal symmetry. In the non-extremal case, the global warped conformal symmetry is singled out by analyzing the scalar wave equation with constant frequency. The local warped conformal symmetries are represented by the charge algebra associated to the vector fields which preserve the scalar wave equation as well as its frequency. In defining the variation of the covariant charges, a proper counterterm is introduced for consistency conditions which is supposed to be suitable for all the solutions within the family. As a consistency check, the horizon entropy is reproduced by the entropy formula of the warped CFT by using its modular covariance and the central terms derived in the bulk spacetimes.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

In both these models, we probe chaos in the particle trajectories (under suitable harmonic confinement) in the vicinity of the black hole horizons, for a set of initial conditions. The particle trajectories, associated Poincar$\acute{e}$ sections, and Lyapunov exponents clearly illustrate the role played by the black hole horizon in the growth of chaos. We find that with increasing energy, the particle trajectories explore regions closer to the black hole horizon, with reduced overlap between two initially close trajectories. We demonstrate how this energy range is controlled by the parameters of the modified gravity theory under consideration. The growth of chaos in such a classical setting is known to respect a surface gravity bound arising from universal aspects of particle dynamics close to the black hole horizon [K. Hashimoto and N. Tanahashi, Phys. Rev. D 95, 024007 (2017)], analogous to the quantum MSS bound [J. Maldacena, S.H. Shenker and D. Stanford, JHEP 08 (2016) 106].

In this paper, we propose a modified model that can significantly reduce the PBH clustering on large scales by considering a time-dependent Hubble-induced mass during inflation. The quasar angular correlation is suppressed by the large Hubble-induced mass in the early stage of inflation while the small Hubble-induced mass in the late stage leads to the AD field fluctuations large enough for PBH formation as in the original model.

The first is that they allow for multiple escapes for the photons (throats in the effective potential of photon geodesic motion). The second is that photon geodesics can resonate between different generalized light-rings related to the escapes, called fundamental photon orbits, that lead photons to alternate between the different exits either towards the compact object or infinity. The resulting fractal structures of the shadow seem to be a generic feature of prolate non-Kerr objects that may be observable in (accretion-disk)-illuminated compact objects, especially along equatorial lines of sight, but the best orientation depends on the specific parameters.

Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}\big(D,\,\log(1/\varepsilon)\big)$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.",{'quantum information theory': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

However, the precise mechanisms and locations responsible for the dissipation of energy within these jets, leading to observable $γ$-ray radiation, remain elusive. We detect evidence for an intrinsic absorption feature in the $γ$-ray spectrum at energies exceeding $10\,$GeV, presumably due to the photon-photon pair production of $γ$-rays with low ionization lines at the outer edge of Broad-line region (BLR), during the high-flux state of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 1424$-$418. The feature can be discriminated from the turnover at higher energies resulting from $γ$-ray absorption in the extragalactic background light. It is absent in the low-flux states supporting the interpretation that powerful dissipation events within or at the edge of the BLR evolve into fainter $γ$-ray emitting zones outside the BLR, possibly associated with the moving VLBI radio knots. The inferred location of $γ$-ray emission zone is consistent with the observed variability time scale of the brightest flare, provided that the flare is attributed to external Compton scattering with BLR photons.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Fermionic quantum criticality through the lens of topological holography,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09611v2,Sheng-Jie Huang,"We utilize the topological holographic framework to characterize and gain insights into the nature of quantum critical points and gapless phases in fermionic quantum systems. Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.",{'holography': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Holography']

Constraining the Low-Mass End of the Black Hole Mass Function and the Active Fraction of the Intermediate-mass Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09441v1,"Hojin Cho, Jong-Hak Woo","We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF), focusing on the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses down to $M_{\bullet}\sim10^4 M_\odot$. Based on the AGNs with a detected broad H$α$ emission line, we construct a sample of 14,242 AGNs at redshift $z<0.35$, including 243 IMBHs with $M_{\bullet}<10^6 M_\odot$. By jointly modeling the BHMF and ERDF via the maximum posterior estimation, we find that the BHMF peaks at $\sim$$10^{6} M_\odot$ and exhibits a relatively constant value of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}}$ at the low-mass end. By comparing the derived BHMF of type 1 AGNs with the galaxy mass function based on the updated black hole mass - host galaxy stellar mass relation, we derive the active fraction. We also determine the active fraction for all AGNs using the upper and lower limit of the type 1 fraction. The active fraction decreases from 15%-40% for massive galaxies ($M_\star>10^{10} M_\odot$) to lower than $\sim$2% for dwarf galaxies with $M_\star\sim10^8 M_\odot$.

Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results.

We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP.

We construct a superoperator that explicitly maps the Ising operators to the dual-Ising operators. The superoperator naturally acts on the tensor product of the Ising and the dual-Ising Hilbert space. We then show that the relation between our superoperator and the Kramers-Wannier duality operator that maps the Ising Hilbert space to the dual-Ising Hilbert space is naturally provided by quantum operations and the duality can be understood as a quantum operation that we construct. We provide the operator-sum representation for the Kramers-Wannier quantum operations and reproduce the well-known fusion rules.

Using the IceCube and latest Fermi-LAT data, we present general multimessenger constraints on the energetics of cosmic rays and the size of neutrino emission regions. In the photohadronic scenario, the required cosmic-ray luminosity should be larger than about 1-10 percent of the Eddington luminosity, and the emission radius should be less than about 15 Schwarzschild radii in low-beta plasma and less than about 3 Schwarzschild radii in high-beta plasma. The leptonic scenario overshoots the NuSTAR or Fermi-LAT data for any emission radii we consider, and the required gamma-ray luminosity is much larger than the Eddington luminosity. The beta decay scenario also violates not only the energetics requirement but also gamma-ray constraints especially when the Bethe-Heitler and photomeson production processes are consistently considered.

Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09277v2,Zhian Jia,"Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and delve into a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We also show that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model.

Continuum emission from within the plunging region of black hole discs,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09175v1,"Andrew Mummery, Adam Ingram, Shane Davis, Andrew Fabian","The thermal continuum emission observed from accreting black holes across X-ray bands has the potential to be leveraged as a powerful probe of the mass and spin of the central black hole. The vast majority of existing ``continuum fitting'' models neglect emission sourced at and within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the black hole. Numerical simulations, however, find non-zero emission sourced from these regions. In this work we extend existing techniques by including the emission sourced from within the plunging region, utilising new analytical models which reproduce the properties of numerical accretion simulations. We show that in general the neglected intra-ISCO emission produces a hot-and-small quasi-blackbody component, but can also produce a weak power-law tail for more extreme parameter regions. A similar hot-and-small blackbody component has been added in by hand in an ad-hoc manner to previous analyses of X-ray binary spectra. We show that the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820+070 in a soft-state outburst is extremely well described by a full Kerr black hole disc, while conventional models which neglect intra-ISCO emission are unable to reproduce the data. We believe this represents the first robust detection of intra-ISCO emission in the literature, and allows additional constraints to be placed on the MAXI J1820+070 black hole spin which must be low $a_\bullet < 0.5$ to allow a detectable intra-ISCO region. Emission from within the ISCO is the dominant emission component in the MAXI J1820+070 spectrum between $6$ and $10$ keV, highlighting the necessity of including this region.

We first apply the Fliess-series expansion to pulse-based QML models to investigate the effect of control system structure on model expressivity, which leads to a universal criterion for assessing the expressivity of generic QML models. Guided by this criterion, we then demonstrate how designing pulse-based models on low-dimensional manifolds can balance expressivity and trainability. Finally, numerical experiments are carried out to verify the proposed criterion and our analysis, which futher demonstrate that increasing dimensionality enhances expressivity but avoids barren plateaus if the model is designed with limited controllability on a submanifold.

A regular center instead of a black bounce,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09124v1,"S. V. Bolokhov, K. A. Bronnikov, M. V.

Instead, it has been recently proposed to make $r=0$ a regular center by properly modifying the metric, still preserving its form in regions far from $r=0$. Different algorithms of such modifications have been formulated for a few classes of singularities. The previous paper considered space-times whose Ricci tensor satisfies the condition $R^t_t =R^r_r$, and regular modifications were obtained for the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordström metrics, and two examples of solutions with magnetic fields obeying nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The present paper considers regular modifications of more general space-times, and as examples, modifications with a regular center have been obtained for the Fisher (also known as JNW) solution with a naked singularity and a family of dilatonic black holes. Possible field sources of the new regular metrics are considered in the framework of general relativity (GR), using the fact that any static, spherically symmetric metric with a combined source involving NED and a scalar field with some self-interaction potential.

Prior works have targeted building better devices and discriminators to reduce its effects, as readout-crosstalk-induced qubit measurement errors are detrimental to the reliability of a quantum computer. However, in this work, we show that beyond the reliability of a system, readout crosstalk can introduce vulnerabilities in a system being shared among multiple users.

Limited spatial and mass resolution and the associated discreteness noise make following the dynamics of black holes especially challenging. In particular, dynamical friction, which is responsible for driving massive black holes towards the centres of galaxies, cannot be accurately modelled with softened $N$-body interactions. A number of subgrid models have been proposed to mimic dynamical friction or directly include its full effects in simulations. Each of these methods has its individual benefits and shortcomings, while all suffer from a common issue of being unable to represent black holes with masses below a few times the simulated dark matter particle mass. In this paper, we propose a correction for unresolved dynamical friction, which has been calibrated on simulations run with the code KETJU, in which gravitational interactions of black holes are not softened. We demonstrate that our correction is able to sink black holes with masses greater than the dark matter particle mass at the correct rate. We show that the impact of stochasticity is significant for low-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \leq 5 M_{\rm DM}$) and propose a correction for stochastic heating.

Motivated by the increasing success of recovering input data from the gradients of classical models, this study addresses a central question: How hard is it to recover the input data from the gradients of quantum machine learning models? Focusing on variational quantum circuits (VQC) as learning models, we uncover the crucial role played by the dynamical Lie algebra (DLA) of the VQC ansatz in determining privacy vulnerabilities. While the DLA has previously been linked to the classical simulatability and trainability of VQC models, this work, for the first time, establishes its connection to the privacy of VQC models. In particular, we show that properties conducive to the trainability of VQCs, such as a polynomial-sized DLA, also facilitate the extraction of detailed snapshots of the input. We term this a weak privacy breach, as the snapshots enable training VQC models for distinct learning tasks without direct access to the original input. Further, we investigate the conditions for a strong privacy breach where the original input data can be recovered from these snapshots by classical or quantum-assisted polynomial time methods. We establish conditions on the encoding map such as classical simulatability, overlap with DLA basis, and its Fourier frequency characteristics that enable such a privacy breach of VQC models.

Scalar Field Perturbation of Hairy Black Holes in EsGB theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08769v1,"Young-Hwan Hyun, Boris Latosh, Miok Park","We investigate scalar field perturbations of the hairy black holes involved with spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global U(1) symmetry in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory for asymptotically flat spacetimes. We consider the mechanism that black holes without hairs become unstable at the critical point of the coupling constant and undergo a phase transition to hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase driven by spontaneous symmetry breaking. This transition occurs near the black hole horizon due to the diminishing influence of the Gauss-Bonnet term at infinity. To examine such process, we introduce a scalar field perturbation on the newly formed background spacetime. We solve the linearized perturbation equation using Green's function method. We begin by solving the Green's function, incorporating the branch cut contribution. This allows us to analytically investigate the late-time behavior of the perturbation at both spatial and null infinity. We found that the late-time behavior only differs from the Schwarzschild black hole by a mass term. We then proceed to calculate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) numerically, which arise from the presence of poles in the Green's function. Our primary interest lies in utilizing QNMs to investigate the stability of the black hole solutions both the symmetric and symmetry-broken phases. Consistent with the prior study, our analysis shows that hairy black holes in the symmetric phase become unstable when the quadratic coupling constant exceeds a critical value for a fixed value of the quartic coupling constant. In contrast, hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase are always stable at the critical value. These numerical results provide strong evidence for a dynamical process that unstable black holes without hairs transition into stable hairy black holes in the symmetry-broken phase through the spontaneous symmetry breaking.",{'black holes': 7},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08758v1,"Chandrachur Chakraborty, Sudip Bhattacharyya, Pankaj S. Joshi","Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Calculating response functions of coupled oscillators using quantum phase estimation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08694v1,"Sven Danz, Mario Berta, Stefan Schröder, Pascal Kienast, Frank K.

The functional form of these response functions can be mapped to a corresponding eigenproblem of a Hermitian matrix $H$, thus suggesting the use of quantum phase estimation. Our proposed quantum algorithm operates in the standard $s$-sparse, oracle-based query access model. For a network of $N$ oscillators with maximum norm $\lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}$, and when the eigenvalue tolerance $\varepsilon$ is much smaller than the minimum eigenvalue gap, we use $\mathcal{O}(\log(N s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/\varepsilon)$ algorithmic qubits and obtain a rigorous worst-case query complexity upper bound $\mathcal{O}(s \lVert H \rVert_{\mathrm{max}}/(δ^2 \varepsilon) )$ up to logarithmic factors, where $δ$ denotes the desired precision on the coefficients appearing in the response functions. Crucially, our proposal does not suffer from the infamous state preparation bottleneck and can as such potentially achieve large quantum speedups compared to relevant classical methods. As a proof-of-principle of exponential quantum speedup, we show that a simple adaptation of our algorithm solves the random glued-trees problem in polynomial time.

Extending Non-Perturbative Simulation Techniques for Open-Quantum Systems to Excited-State Proton Transfer and Ultrafast Non-Adiabatic Dynamics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08693v1,"Brieuc Le Dé, Simon Huppert, Riccardo Spezia, Alex W.

However, the simulation of such dynamics involves multiple challenges, since high-dimensional, out-of-equilibrium vibronic states play a crucial role, while a fully quantum description of the proton's dissipative, real-space dynamics is also required. In this work, we extend the powerful Matrix Product State approach to open quantum systems (TEDOPA) to study these demanding dynamics, and also more general non-adiabatic processes that can appear in complex photochemistry subject to strong laser driving. As an illustration, we initially consider an open model of a four-level electronic system interacting with hundreds of intramolecular vibrations that drive ultrafast excited state proton transfer, as well as an explicit photonic environment that allows us to directly monitor the resulting dual fluorescence in this system. We then demonstrate how to include a continuous 'reaction coordinate' of the proton transfer that allows numerically exact simulations that can be understood, visualized and interpreted in the familiar language of diabatic and adiabatic dynamics on potential surfaces, while also retaining an exact quantum treatment of dissipation and driving effects that could be used to study diverse problems in ultrafast photochemistry.",{'matrix product state': 1},05.2024,2024,05,[]

In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(φ)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during the FR stage is amplified in comparison with slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBHs production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $Ω_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-γ}$. The spectral index $γ=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in radiation-dominated (RD) era.

With such low masses, general relativity predicts that the corresponding radii for the PBHs would be atomic or subatomic in size. When captured by a star, such a tiny PBH could exhibit an orbit completely or partially inside the body of the star, without significantly changing its mass for quite a long time. Here we examine the possible trajectories of a PBH that is captured by a Sun-like star. When in motion in the interior of the star, the amount of stellar mass that effectively interacts with the PBH will be a function of its distance to the center of the star.

It is thus a crucial guidepost to know when selecting a particular PQC ansatz. However, the existing technique for expressibility computation through statistical estimation requires a large number of samples, which poses significant challenges due to time and computational resource constraints. This paper introduces a novel approach for expressibility estimation of PQCs using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

To achieve this, we linearly deform both the bulk geometry and the bulk matter distribution with respect to a coupling constant. These deformations induce a transition from a $5D$ vacuum AdS distribution to an anisotropic distribution. The latter results in the induced geometry on the brane transitioning from a singular Schwarzschild spacetime to a regularized SV spacetime. Since there are no sources or matter fields on the brane, we can assert that the induced SV geometry on the brane arises from the influence of geometrical and matter deformations in the bulk. Thus, the central singularity is suppressed. We determine the cases where the energy conditions are either satisfied or violated. Our spacetime is asymptotically radial AdS, which is intriguing given the absence of a global AdS box that would prevent instability under larger wavelength perturbations.

The extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes: an exact charged scalar quasiresonance,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07579v1,"David Senjaya, Supakchai Ponglertsakul","In this letter, we present a novel exact scalar quasibound states solutions in the extremal Reissner-Norström black hole background. We start with the construction of the governing covariant relativistic scalar field equation, the Klein-Gordon equation in the extremal Reissner-Norström black hole background and applying the separation of variables anzat. The exact relativistic scalar wave's angular solution is found in terms of the spherical harmonics while the two independent radial wave solutions are, for the first time, exactly found and presented in terms of the double confluent Heun functions. The solutions are settled in the gravitational potential well and behave like an ingoing waves approaching black hole's horizon, vanishing when approaching infinity. The gravitationally bounded charged massive scalar fields are found to have quantized complex valued energy levels while imaginary energy levels are obtained for the charged massless scalar field, of both cases, indicating decaying states. Further investigation shows that the extreme Reissner-Nordstöm black hole does not support scalar cloud. And with the help of the obtained exact radial solutions, the Hawking radiation of the extremal Reissner-Nordstöm black hole is investigated and we find the zero temperature of the black hole's horizon.",{'hawking radiation': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Apparent and emergent dark matter around a Schwarzschild black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07531v2,Reggie C. Pantig,"Inspired by the two different dark matter frameworks that were studied recently: one that arises from the non-local effects of entanglement entropy as emergent gravity (characterized by the parameter $ξ(M)$, and zero-point scale length $l$), and one from dark energy viewed as a superconducting medium (characterized by $η(M)$, and screening length parameter $λ_{\rm G}$), two black hole solutions spherically surrounded with these dark matter models were derived. The effect of these two frameworks on SMBH was analyzed through the resulting deviations in the null regions and the black hole shadow. In addition, constraints to the parameters $ξ$ and $η$ (at $3σ$ level) were found using the available EHT data for Sgr. A* and M87*. These constraints allow one to deduce the effective mass $M$, which causes uncertainties in the measurement. On the other hand, if the effective mass is known, one can also deduce the constants associated with $ξ$, and $η$. The former framework also introduces an Appell function, a hypergeometric function of two variables that separately allows the analysis of macroscopic and (hypothetical) microscopic black holes. This first framework was found to decrease the radii of the null regions respective to the Schwarzschild counterpart. The shadow radius, however, behaves reversibly. The result of the numerical analysis for the latter framework revealed increased values for the photonsphere and shadow radii. Remarkably, the study also showed that for SMBHs, the amplifying effects of $λ_{\rm G}$ are stronger than the scale length $l$. Finally, results of constraints, as an example, for the upper bound in $ξ$ for M87* indicated that the effective mass causing the deviation was around $2.4\times 10^{20} M_{\odot}$ given that the observed Milgrom's constant is $5.4\times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2$.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Thermodynamical topology with multiple defect curves for dyonic AdS black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07525v1,"Zi-Qing Chen, Shao-Wen Wei","Dyonic black holes with quasitopological electromagnetism exhibit an intriguing phase diagram with two separated first-order coexistence curves. In this paper, we aim to uncover its influence on the black hole thermodynamical topology. At first, we investigate the phase transition and phase diagram of the dyonic black holes. Comparing with previous study that there is no black hole phase transition region for a middle pressure, we find this region can narrow or disappear by fine tuning the coupling parameter. Instead, two first-order phase transitions can be observed. Importantly, we uncover that such novel phase diagram shall lead to a multiple defect curve phenomenon in black hole topology where each dyonic black hole is treated as one defect in the thermodynamical parameter space. By examining the topology, it is shown that there could be one, three, or five black hole states for given pressure and temperature. For each case, the topological number is calculated. Our results show that the topological number always takes value of +1, keeping unchanged even when the multiple defect curves appear.

Influence of Black Hole Kick Velocity on Microlensing Distributions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07502v1,"Naoki Koshimoto, Norita Kawanaka, Daichi Tsuna","The natal kick velocity distribution for black holes (BHs) is unknown regardless of its importance for understanding the BH formation process. Gravitational microlensing is a unique tool for studying the distribution of BHs in our Galaxy, and the first isolated stellar-mass BH event, OGLE-2011-BLG-0462/MOA-2011-BLG-191 (OB110462), was recently identified by astrometric microlensing. This study investigates how the natal kick velocity for Galactic BHs affects the microlensing event rate distribution. We consider a Maxwell distribution with various average kick velocities, as well as the consequent variation of the spatial distribution of BHs. We find that the event rate for the BH lenses toward the Galactic bulge decreases as $v_{\rm avg}$ increases, mainly due to the scale height inflation. We focus on the unique microlensing parameters measured for OB110462, with microlens parallax $π_{\rm E}$ larger than 0.06 for its long timescale of $t_{\rm E} > 200~$ days. We calculate the expected number of BH events occurring with parameters similar to OB110462 during the OGLE-IV survey by Mróz et al. (2017, 2019) and compare it with the actual number that occurred, at least one. Our fiducial model predicts 0.26, 0.19, 0.095, 0.020, and $1.8 \times 10^{-3}$ events occurring for $v_{\rm avg} =$ 25 km/sec, 50 km/sec, 100 km/sec, 200 km/sec, and 400 km/sec, respectively, which suggests that the average kick velocity is likely to be $v_{\rm avg} \lesssim 100~{\rm km/sec}$. The expected number smaller than unity even at maximum might indicate our luckiness of finding OB110462, which can be tested with future surveys by e.g. the Roman space telescope.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Separable Power of Classical and Quantum Learning Protocols Through the Lens of No-Free-Lunch Theorem,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.07226v1,"Xinbiao Wang, Yuxuan Du, Kecheng Liu, Yong Luo, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao","The No-Free-Lunch (NFL) theorem, which quantifies problem- and data-independent generalization errors regardless of the optimization process, provides a foundational framework for comprehending diverse learning protocols' potential. Despite its significance, the establishment of the NFL theorem for quantum machine learning models remains largely unexplored, thereby overlooking broader insights into the fundamental relationship between quantum and classical learning protocols. To address this gap, we categorize a diverse array of quantum learning algorithms into three learning protocols designed for learning quantum dynamics under a specified observable and establish their NFL theorem. The exploited protocols, namely Classical Learning Protocols (CLC-LPs), Restricted Quantum Learning Protocols (ReQu-LPs), and Quantum Learning Protocols (Qu-LPs), offer varying levels of access to quantum resources. Our derived NFL theorems demonstrate quadratic reductions in sample complexity across CLC-LPs, ReQu-LPs, and Qu-LPs, contingent upon the orthogonality of quantum states and the diagonality of observables. We attribute this performance discrepancy to the unique capacity of quantum-related learning protocols to indirectly utilize information concerning the global phases of non-orthogonal quantum states, a distinctive physical feature inherent in quantum mechanics. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of quantum learning protocols' capabilities but also provide practical insights for the development of advanced quantum learning algorithms.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We present a systematic methodology for constructing the QAOA tailored mixer Hamiltonian, ensuring alignment with the inherent symmetries of classical optimization problem objectives. The key to our approach is to identify an operator that commutes with the action of the group of symmetries on the QAOA underlying Hilbert space and meets the essential technical criteria for effective mixer Hamiltonian functionality. We offer a construction method specifically tailored to the symmetric group $S_d$, prevalent in a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. By rigorously validating the required properties, providing a concrete formula and corresponding quantum circuit for implementation, we establish the viability of the proposed mixer Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the classical mixer $B$ commutes only with a subgroup of $S_d$ of significantly smaller order than the group itself, enhancing the efficiency of the proposed approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology, we compare two QAOA variants utilizing different mixer Hamiltonians: conventional $B=\sum X_i$ and the newly proposed $H_M$ in edge coloring and graph partitioning problems across various graphs. We observe statistically significant differences in mean values, with the new variant consistently demonstrating superior performance across multiple independent simulations.

We evolve the ideal MHD equations on a wormhole spacetime described by the spherically symmetric Simpson--Visser metric. The disk is initialized on one side of the wormhole and accretes onto the throat driven by the magneto-rotational instability (MRI). We show that the inflowing plasma quickly settles in the throat and forms a hot, rotating cloud. The wormhole cloud acts as an engine in which gas coming from one side accumulates at the center, dissipates energy, and powers a mildly relativistic thermal wind toward the other side. Our novel predictions show that accreting wormholes behave very differently from black holes (BHs) in astrophysical environments. In particular, one mouth presents outflows without accretion signatures, contradicting the jet-disk symbiotic relation that holds for black holes.","{'black holes': 2, 'traversable wormholes': 1}",05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
The Algorithm for Solving Quantum Linear Systems of Equations With Coherent Superposition and Its Extended Applications,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06888v1,"Qiqing Xia, Qianru Zhu, Huiqin Xie, Li Yang","Many quantum algorithms for attacking symmetric cryptography involve the rank problem of quantum linear equations. In this paper, we first propose two quantum algorithms for solving quantum linear systems of equations with coherent superposition and construct their specific quantum circuits. Unlike previous related works, our quantum algorithms are universal. Specifically, the two quantum algorithms can both compute the rank and general solution by one measurement. The difference between them is whether the data register containing the quantum coefficient matrix can be disentangled with other registers and keep the data qubits unchanged. On this basis, we apply the two quantum algorithms as a subroutine to parallel Simon's algorithm (with multiple periods), Grover Meets Simon algorithm, and Alg-PolyQ2 algorithm, respectively. Afterwards, we construct a quantum classifier within Grover Meets Simon algorithm and the test oracle within Alg-PolyQ2 algorithm in detail, including their respective quantum circuits. To our knowledge, no such specific analysis has been done before. We rigorously analyze the success probability of those algorithms to ensure that the success probability based on the proposed quantum algorithms will not be lower than that of those original algorithms. Finally, we discuss the lower bound of the number of CNOT gates for solving quantum linear systems of equations with coherent superposition, and our quantum algorithms reach the optimum in terms of minimizing the number of CNOT gates.

We consider following an effective field theory (EFT) approach and study the quantum loop corrections to the power spectrum from each phase. We demonstrate the complete removal of quadratic UV divergences after renormalization and softened logarithmic IR divergences after resummation and illustrate the scheme-independent nature of our renormalization approach. We further show that the addition of a contracting and bouncing phase allows us to successfully generate PBHs of solar-mass order, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(M_{\odot})$, by achieving the minimum e-folds during inflation to be $ΔN_{\rm Total}\sim {\cal O}(60)$ and in this process successfully evading the strict no-go theorem. We notice that varying the effective sound speed between $0.88\leq c_{s}\leq 1$, allows the peak spectrum amplitude to lie within $10^{-3}\leq A \leq 10^{-2}$, indicating that causality and unitarity remain protected in the theory. We analyse PBHs in the extremely small, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-33}-10^{-27})M_{\odot}$, and the large, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-6}-10^{-1})M_{\odot}$, mass limits and confront the PBH abundance results with the latest microlensing constraints.

When the entanglement structure of the quantum state of interest is non-uniform in real space, accurately representing the state with a limited number of degrees of freedom hinges on appropriately configuring the TN to align with the entanglement pattern. However, a proposal has yet to show a structural search of ER due to its high computational cost and the lack of flexibility in its algorithm. In this study, we conducted an optimal structural search of TN, including ER, based on the reconstruction of their local structures with respect to variational energy. Firstly, we demonstrated that our algorithm for the spin-$1/2$ tetramer singlets model could calculate exact ground energy using the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) structure as an initial TN structure. Subsequently, we applied our algorithm to the random XY models with the two initial structures: MERA and the suitable structure underlying the strong disordered renormalization group. We found that, in both cases, our algorithm achieves improvements in variational energy, fidelity, and entanglement entropy. The degree of improvement in these quantities is superior in the latter case compared to the former, suggesting that utilizing an existing TN design method as a preprocessing step is important for maximizing our algorithm's performance.","{'MERA': 2, 'entanglement renormalization': 2, 'tensor network': 1}",05.2024,2024,05,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

We investigate how kicks alter the velocity distribution of objects born in the Milky Way disc, both immediately after the kick and at later times, and whether these kicks are encoded in the observed population of Galactic neutron stars. We simulate the Galactic trajectories of point masses on circular orbits in the disc after being perturbed by an isotropic kick, with a Maxwellian distribution of magnitudes with $σ=265$ km/s. Then, we simulate the motion of these point masses for $200$ Myr. These trajectories are then evaluated, either for the Milky Way population as a whole or for those passing within two kiloparsecs of the Sun, to get the time evolution of the velocities. During the first $20$ Myr, the bulk velocity of kicked objects becomes temporarily aligned to the cylindrical radius, implying an anisotropy in the velocity orientations. Beyond this age, the velocity distribution shifts toward lower values and settles to a median of $\sim200$ km/s. Around the Sun, the distribution also loses its upper tail, primarily due to unbound objects escaping the Galaxy. We compare this to the velocities of Galactic pulsars and find that pulsars show a similar evolution with characteristic age. The shift of the velocity distribution is due to bound objects spending most of their orbits at larger radii after the kick. They are, therefore, decelerated by the Galactic potential. We find the same deceleration to be predicted for nearby objects and the total population and conclude it is also observed in Galactic pulsars.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Gravitating Scalarons with Inverted Higgs Potential,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06407v1,"Xiao Yan Chew, Kok-Geng Lim","Previously, a class of regular and asymptotically flat gravitating scalar solitons (scalarons) has been constructed in the Einstein--Klein--Gordon (EKG) theory by adopting a phantom field with Higgs-like potential where the kinetic term has the wrong sign and the scalaron possesses the negative Arnowitt--Deser--Misner (ADM) mass as a consequence. In this paper, we demonstrate that the use of the phantom field can be avoided by inverting the Higgs-like potential in the EKG system when the kinetic term has a proper sign, such that the corresponding gravitating scalaron can possess the positive ADM mass. We systematically study the basic properties of the gravitating scalaron, such as the ADM mass, the energy conditions, the geodesics of test particles, etc. Moreover, we find that it can be smoothly connected to the counterpart hairy black hole solutions from our recent work in the small horizon limit.",{'geodesics': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

A discontinuous Galerkin scheme for elliptic equations on extremely stretched grids,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06120v1,Nils L. Vu,"Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods for solving elliptic equations are gaining popularity in the computational physics community for their high-order spectral convergence and their potential for parallelization on computing clusters. However, problems in numerical relativity with extremely stretched grids, such as initial data problems for binary black holes that impose boundary conditions at large distances from the black holes, have proven challenging for DG methods. To alleviate this problem we have developed a primal DG scheme that is generically applicable to a large class of elliptic equations, including problems on curved and extremely stretched grids. The DG scheme accommodates two widely used initial data formulations in numerical relativity, namely the puncture formulation and the extended conformal thin-sandwich (XCTS) formulation. We find that our DG scheme is able to stretch the grid by a factor of $\sim 10^9$ and hence allows to impose boundary conditions at large distances. The scheme converges exponentially with resolution both for the smooth XCTS problem and for the non-smooth puncture problem. With this method we are able to generate high-quality initial data for binary black hole problems using a parallelizable DG scheme. The code is publicly available in the open-source SpECTRE numerical relativity code.",{'black holes': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the non-stabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of non-stabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling its efficient evaluation while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using an approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor networks simulations.

III) stars are one of the main high-redshift targets for next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Their predicted initial mass function and lack of metals make them the ideal progenitors of black holes above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap, i.e. with a mass higher than $\approx{}134$ (241) M$_\odot$ for stars that become (do not become) chemically homogeneous during their evolution. Here, we investigate the effects of cluster dynamics on the mass function of BBHs born from Pop. III stars, by considering the main uncertainties on Pop. III star mass function, orbital properties of binary systems, star cluster's mass and disruption time. In our dynamical models, at least $\sim$5% and up to 100% BBH mergers in Pop. III star clusters have primary mass $m_1$ above the upper edge of the pair-instability mass gap. In contrast, only $\lesssim {} 3$% isolated BBH mergers have primary mass above the gap, unless their progenitors evolved as chemically homogeneous stars. The lack of systems with primary and/or secondary mass inside the gap defines a zone of avoidance with sharp boundaries in the primary mass - mass ratio plane. Finally, we estimate the merger rate density of BBHs and, in the most optimistic case, we find a maximum of $\mathcal{R}\approx200\,{\rm Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$ at $z\sim15$ for BBHs formed via dynamical capture.

Power-law entanglement and Hilbert space fragmentation in non-reciprocal quantum circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06021v1,"Kai Klocke, Joel E. Moore, Michael Buchhold","Quantum circuits utilizing measurement to evolve a quantum wave function offer a new and rich playground to engineer unconventional entanglement dynamics. Here we introduce a hybrid, non-reciprocal setup featuring a quantum circuit, whose updates are conditioned on the state of a classical dynamical agent. In our example the circuit is represented by a Majorana quantum chain controlled by a classical $N$-state Potts chain undergoing pair-flips. The local orientation of the classical spins controls whether randomly drawn local measurements on the quantum chain are allowed or not. This imposes a dynamical kinetic constraint on the entanglement growth, described by the transfer matrix of an $N$-colored loop model. It yields an equivalent description of the circuit by an $SU(N)$-symmetric Temperley-Lieb Hamiltonian or by a kinetically constrained surface growth model for an $N$-component height field. For $N=2$, we find a diffusive growth of the half-chain entanglement towards a stationary profile $S(L)\sim L^{1/2}$ for $L$ sites. For $N\ge3$, the kinetic constraints impose Hilbert space fragmentation, yielding subdiffusive growth towards $S(L)\sim L^{0.57}$. This showcases how the control by a classical dynamical agent can enrich the entanglement dynamics in quantum circuits, paving a route toward novel entanglement dynamics in non-reciprocal hybrid circuit architectures.",{'quantum circuit': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

However, only a few debated candidate black holes exist between 150 and $10^5$ Msun. Determining the population of these intermediate-mass black holes is an important step towards understanding supermassive black hole formation in the early universe. Several studies have claimed the detection of a central black hole in $ω$ Centauri, the Milky Way's most massive globular cluster. However, these studies have been questioned due to the possible mass contribution of stellar mass black holes, their sensitivity to the cluster center, and the lack of fast-moving stars above the escape velocity. Here we report observations of seven fast-moving stars in the central 3 arcseconds (0.08 pc) of $ω$ Centauri. The velocities of the fast-moving stars are significantly higher than the expected central escape velocity of the star cluster, so their presence can only be explained by being bound to a massive black hole.

Wormhole restrictions from quantum energy inequalities,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05963v1,Eleni-Alexandra Kontou,"Wormhole solutions, bridges that connect different parts of spacetime, were proposed early in the history of General Relativity. Soon after, it was shown that all wormholes violate classical energy conditions, non-negativity constraints on contractions of the stress-energy tensor. Since these are violated by quantum fields, it was believed that wormholes can be constructed in the context of semiclassical gravity. But negative energies in quantum field theory are not without restriction: quantum energy inequalities (QEIs) control renormalized negative energies averaged over a geodesic. Thus, QEIs provide restrictions on the construction of wormholes. This work is a review of the relevant literature, focusing on results where QEIs restrict traversable wormholes.

A key challenge in this domain is efficiently allocating logical qubits from quantum circuits to the physical qubits within QPUs, a task known to be NP-hard. Traditional approaches, primarily focused on graph partitioning strategies, have sought to reduce the number of required Bell pairs for executing non-local CNOT operations, a form of gate teleportation. However, these methods have limitations in terms of efficiency and scalability. Addressing this, our work jointly considers gate and qubit teleportations introducing a novel meta-heuristic algorithm to minimise the network cost of executing a quantum circuit. By allowing dynamic reallocation of qubits along with gate teleportations during circuit execution, our method significantly enhances the overall efficacy and potential scalability of DQC frameworks. In our numerical analysis, we demonstrate that integrating qubit teleportations into our genetic algorithm for optimising circuit blocking reduces the required resources, specifically the number of EPR pairs, compared to traditional graph partitioning methods. Our results, derived from both benchmark and randomly generated circuits, show that as circuit complexity increases - demanding more qubit teleportations - our approach effectively optimises these teleportations throughout the execution, thereby enhancing performance through strategic circuit partitioning.

We found that the mass-scaled characteristic timescales, ranging from the microquasars of stellar-mass black holes to the blazars of supermassive black holes, exhibited a linear relationship with a slope of $\sim$0.57. Given the fact the damping timescales of the $γ$-ray in the blazars are associated with the jet, we propose that the timescales of the X-ray in these microquasars are also related with the jet. The mass-scaled damping timescale that we found was consistent with the radiation of the optical accretion disk. This can be attributed to the viscous timescale at the ultraviolet-emitting radii of the disk, which can affect the jet.

White,"Every year, substantial theoretical and experimental progress is made towards the realisation of a genuinely new computational paradigm in the construction of a quantum computer. But progress is fractal; to make headway is to unearth the next set of obstacles. Decades of work has so far overcome physical, mathematical, engineering, and information theoretic obstacles to produce the remarkable high-fidelity devices we see today. But these devices must be near perfect to be useful. Indeed, advancements so far have precipitated sensitivity to a host of complex dynamical and control-based effects. Chief among these today are non-Markovian memory effects, where interactions between a quantum system and its surrounding environment can give rise to multi-time correlations. In this thesis, we address this issue and formally present a generalisation of quantum process tomography, called process tensor tomography (PTT). This establishes the ability to rigorously and systematically characterise non-Markovian open quantum systems, resolving many long-standing issues in the field. In the first part of this work, we present an original review of the literature and motivate the problem at hand. In the second, we develop the framework of PTT, including experiment design, post-processing algorithms, and both simulated and near-term device demonstrations.

From Young Massive Clusters to Old Globular Clusters: Density Profile Evolution and IMBH Formation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05397v1,"Kuldeep Sharma, Carl L. Rodriguez","The surface brightness profiles of globular clusters are conventionally described with the well-known King profile. However, observations of young massive clusters (YMCs) in the local Universe suggest that they are better fit by simple models with flat central cores and simple power-law densities in their outer regions (such as the Elson-Fall-Freeman, or EFF, profile). Depending on their initial central density, these YMCs may also facilitate large numbers of stellar collisions, potentially creating very massive stars that will directly collapse to intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). Using Monte Carlo $N$-body models of YMCs, we show that EFF-profile clusters transform to Wilson or King profiles through natural dynamical evolution, but that their final $W_0$ parameters do not strongly correlate to their initial concentrations. The most centrally-dense YMCs can produce runaway stellar mergers as massive as $4000\,M_{\odot}$ (the largest resolved mass in our simulations) which can collapse to produce IMBHs of similar masses. In doing so, these runaway collisions also deplete the clusters of their primordial massive stars, reducing the number of stellar-mass BHs by as much as $\sim$ 40\%. This depletion will accelerate the core collapse of clusters, suggesting that the process of IMBH formation itself may produce the high densities observed in some core-collapsed clusters.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Hampton","Microstate geometries are proposed microstates of black holes which can be described within supergravity. Even though their number may not reproduce the full entropy of black holes with finite-sized horizons, they still offer a glimpse into the microscopic structure of black holes. In this paper we construct a new set of microstate geometries of the supersymmetric D1-D5-P black hole, where the momentum charge is carried by a vector field, as seen from the perspective of six-dimensional supergravity. To aid our construction, we develop an algorithm which solves a complicated partial differential equation using the regularity of the geometries. The new solutions are asymptotically AdS$_3\times S^3$, and have a long, but finite AdS$_2$ throat that caps off without ever developing a horizon. These microstate geometries have a holographic interpretation as coherent superpositions of heavy states in the boundary D1-D5 CFT. We identify the states which are dual to our newly constructed solutions and carry out some basic consistency checks to support our identification.",{'black holes': 3},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Together with the presence of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at z>6, this raises questions about the formation and growth histories of early black holes. Current theories for the formation of seed black holes from the death of the first stars (i.e. light seeds) and/or the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds (i.e. heavy seeds) still lack observational confirmation. Here, we present LID-568, a low-mass (7.2e6Msun) black hole hosting powerful outflows that is observed in an extreme phase of rapid growth at z~4. This object is similar to other JWST-discovered faint AGN populations, but is bright in X-ray emission and accreting at more than 4000% of the limit at which radiation pressure exceeds the force of gravitational attraction of the black hole (i.e. super-Eddington accretion). Analysis of JWST NIRSpec/IFU data reveals spatially extended Ha emission with velocities of ~ -600 - -500 km/s relative to the central black hole, indicative of robust nuclear-driven outflows. LID-568 represents an elusive low-mass black hole experiencing super-Eddington accretion as invoked by models of early black hole formation.

Typically, barren plateaus are associated with deep circuits, while shallow circuits have been shown to suffer from suboptimal local minima. We point out a simple mechanism that creates exponentially many poor local minima specifically in the barren plateau regime. These local minima are trivial solutions, optimizing only a few terms in the loss function, leaving the rest on their barren plateaus. More precisely, we show the existence of approximate local minima, optimizing a single loss term, and conjecture the existence of exact local minima, optimizing only a logarithmic fraction of all loss function terms. One implication of our findings is that simply yielding large gradients is not sufficient to render an initialization strategy a meaningful solution to the barren plateau problem.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

This construction is particularly suitable when given a family of tensor networks that can be viewed as the ground states of $d$ dimensional lattice systems, for which we construct the closed $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature, which is a generalization of the well known 2-form Berry curvature. Such $(d+2)$-form higher Berry curvature characterizes a flow of $(d+1)$-form higher Berry curvature in the system. Our construction is equally suitable for constructing other higher pumps, such as the (higher) Thouless pump in the presence of a global on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which corresponds to a closed $d$-form. The cohomology classes of such higher differential forms are topological invariants and are expected to be quantized for short-range entangled states.

Is the James Webb Space Telescope detecting too many AGN candidates?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05319v1,Melanie Habouzit,"In less than two years of operation, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has already accelerated significantly our quest to identify active massive black holes (BHs) in the first billion years of the Universe's history. At the time of writing, about 50 AGN detections and candidates have been identified through spectroscopy, photometry, and/or morphology. Broad-line AGN are about a hundred times more numerous than the faint end of the UV-bright quasar population at z~5-6. In this paper, we compare the observational constraints on the abundance of these AGN at z~5 to the populations of AGN produced in large-scale cosmological simulations. Assuming a null fraction of obscured simulated AGN, we find that while some simulations produce more AGN than discovered so far, some others produce a similar abundance or even fewer AGN in the bolometric luminosity range probed by JWST. Keeping in mind the large uncertainty on the constraints, we discuss the implications for the theoretical modeling of BH formation and evolution in case similar constraints continue to accumulate. At the redshift of interest, the simulated AGN populations diverge the most at Lbol~1e44 erg/s (by more than a dex in the bolometric luminosity function). This regime is most affected by incompleteness in JWST surveys. However, it holds significant potential for constraining the physical processes determining the assembly of BHs (e.g., seeding, feedback from supernova and AGN) and the current abundance of broad-line AGN with >1e44.5 erg/s.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
AGN flares as counterparts to the mergers detected by LIGO and Virgo: a novel spatial correlation analysis,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05318v1,"Niccolò Veronesi, Sjoert van Velzen, Elena Maria Rossi","The primary formation channel for the stellar-mass Binary Black Holes which have been detected merging by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration is yet to be discerned. One of the main obstacles is that such Gravitational Wave (GW) events are not in general expected to produce an Electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. This might not be the case if the mergers happen in gaseous environments, such as the accretion discs of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Recently, 20 AGN flares detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility have been investigated as potential counterparts of GW events by Graham et al. (2023). We present a new spatial correlation analysis involving such events that uses the up-to-date posterior samples of 78 mergers detected during the third observing run of the LVK collaboration. We apply a likelihood method which takes into account the exact position of the EM signal within the 3D sky map of the GW events. We find that current data favour the hypothesis of no causal connection between the detected mergers and the AGN flares. We place an upper limit of 0.155 at a 90 per cent credibility level on the fraction of coalescences that are physically related to a flare. Moreover, we show that the mass distribution of the merging binaries that appear in coincidence with AGN flares, characterised by values typically larger than the ones of the full population of GW events, is also consistent with the no-connection hypothesis. This is because of a positive correlation between the binary mass and the reconstruction volume.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

The role of AGN winds in galaxy formation: connecting AGN outflows at low redshifts to the formation/evolution of their host galaxies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05184v1,"Juan Pablo Torres-Papaqui, Roger Coziol, Aitor C. Robleto-Orus, Karla A. Cutiva-Alvarez, Paulina Roco-Avilez","Using SDSS spectra, we applied an automatic method to search for outflows (OFs) in three large samples of narrow-line AGN at low redshifts (z < 0.4), separated in three spectral activity classes: radio-loud RG, 15,793, radio-quiet, Sy2, 18,585, and LINER, 25,656. In general, the probability of detecting an OF decreases along the sequence Sy1->Sy2->LINER/RG and, independently of the AGN class, the wind velocity, traced by W80, increases with the AGN luminosity. Moreover W80 is systematically higher in RG or any of the other AGN class when detected in radio. These results support the idea that there are two main modes of production of OF, the radiative mode dominant in radio-quiet AGN and the jet mode dominant in radio-loud galaxies, although both modes could also happen simultaneously at different levels. From the spectra and SDSS photometry, the characteristics of the AGN host galaxies and their super-massive black holes (SMBHs) were also retrieved using the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT. This revealed that, independently of their spectral class, 1) galaxy hosts with OFs have systematically later morphological types and higher star formation rates than their counterpart without OF, 2) they occupy different positions in the specific diagnostic diagram, sSMBH vs. sSFR, which suggests they follow different evolutionary paths congruent with the morphology of their galaxy hosts, and 3) they show no evidence of AGN quenching or triggering of star formation. These results are consistent with a scenario explaining the different AGN classes as consequences of different formation processes of galaxies: early-type galaxies (LINER and RG) formed bigger bulges and more massive SMBHs, exhausting their reservoir of gas more rapidly than late-type galaxies (Sy2 and Sy1), quenching their star formation and starving their SMBHs.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05178v2,Yoshiki Fukusumi,"Generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, plays a central role in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). The generators of such symmetries have a close connection to non-abelian anyonic objects in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we revisit the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion"" which corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs. This is a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and can be interpreted as a version of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography has been expected to be applicable to the systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).",{'holography': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Holography']
Fast Fourier transforms and fast Wigner and Weyl functions in large quantum systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05163v1,"C. Lei, A. Vourdas","Two methods for fast Fourier transforms are used in a quantum context. The first method is for systems with dimension of the Hilbert space $D=d^n$ with $d$ an odd integer, and is inspired by the Cooley-Tukey formalism. The `large Fourier transform' is expressed as a sequence of $n$ `small Fourier transforms' (together with some other transforms) in quantum systems with $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Limitations of the method are discussed. In some special cases, the $n$ Fourier transforms can be performed in parallel. The second method is for systems with dimension of the Hilbert space $D=d_0...d_{n-1}$ with $d_0,...,d_{n-1}$ odd integers coprime to each other. It is inspired by the Good formalism, which in turn is based on the Chinese reminder theorem. In this case also the `large Fourier transform' is expressed as a sequence of $n$ `small Fourier transforms' (that involve some constants related to the number theory that describes the formalism). The `small Fourier transforms' can be performed in a classical computer or in a quantum computer (in which case we have the additional well known advantages of quantum Fourier transform circuits). In the case that the small Fourier transforms are performed with a classical computer, complexity arguments for both methods show the reduction in computational time from ${\cal O}(D^2)$ to ${\cal O}(D\log D)$.

The black holes in these merger events naturally form two interesting samples, a pre-merger sample that includes all the black holes before the mergers and a post-merger sample that consists of the black holes generated during the merging processes. The former represents black holes that once existed in the Universe, while the latter represents newly born black holes. Here we present a statistical analysis on these two samples. The non-parametric $τ$ statistic method is adopted to correct for the observational selection effect. The Lynden-Bell's $C^{-}$ method is further applied to derive the mass distribution and density function of black holes. It is found that the mass distribution can be expressed as a broken power-law function. More interestingly, the power-law index in the high mass region is comparable for the two samples. The number density of black holes is found to depend on redshift as $ρ(z) \propto z^{-2.06}$-$z^{-2.12}$ based on the two samples.

Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a Heron superconducting quantum processor.

However, these models all have local Hilbert space dimension larger than two, making the study of their ground state behavior difficult on current qubit-based variational quantum simulation platforms. In this work, we focus on the cost of simulating the local approximations of ground states of these models using qubit-based parameterized quantum circuits. The local approximations, which are 3-site reduced density matrices with local Hilbert space dimension three, are purified then encoded into permutation-symmetric qubits.

In this paper, we analyze the effects of dropping a test particle into an extremal quantum rotating BTZ black hole, whose three-dimensional metric captures the exact backreaction from strongly coupled quantum conformal fields. Our analysis reveals that, despite the inclusion of quantum effects, and akin to the classical scenario, these attempts to destroy the black hole are doomed to be unsuccessful. Particles carrying the maximum angular momentum and still falling into an extremal quantum BTZ black hole can, at most, leave it extremal.

Leo Kim, Qinrui Liu, Aaron C. Vincent","We demonstrate a novel mechanism for producing dark compact objects and black holes through a dark sector, where all the dark matter can be dissipative. Heavy dark sector particles with masses above $10^4$ GeV can come to dominate the Universe and yield an early matter-dominated era before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). Density perturbations in this epoch can grow and collapse into tiny dark matter halos, which cool via self interactions. The typical halo size is set by the Hubble length once perturbations begin growing, offering a straightforward prediction of the halo size and evolution depending on ones choice of dark matter model. Once these primordial halos have formed, a thermal phase transition can then shift the Universe back into radiation domination and standard cosmology. These halos can continue to collapse after BBN, resulting in the late-time formation of fragmented dark compact objects and sub-solar mass primordial black holes. We find that these compact objects can constitute a sizable fraction of all of dark matter. The resulting fragments can have masses between $10^{20}$ g to $10^{32}$ g, with radii ranging from $10^{-2}$ m to $10^5$ m, while the black holes can have masses between $10^{8}$ g to $10^{34}$ g.

Since the numerical evaluation of these quantities is exponentially costly in the Rényi parameter, we verify this numerically for low Rényi parameters and accessible system sizes and provide numerical results for the long-range SRE in other bipartitions.",{'quantum circuit': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Data augmentation experiments with style-based quantum generative adversarial networks on trapped-ion and superconducting-qubit technologies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04401v1,Julien Baglio,"In the current noisy intermediate scale quantum computing era, and after the significant progress of the quantum hardware we have seen in the past few years, it is of high importance to understand how different quantum algorithms behave on different types of hardware. This includes whether or not they can be implemented at all and, if so, what the quality of the results is. This work quantitatively demonstrates, for the first time, how the quantum generator architecture for the style-based quantum generative adversarial network (qGAN) can not only be implemented but also yield good results on two very different types of hardware for data augmentation: the IBM bm_torino quantum computer based on the Heron chip using superconducting transmon qubits and the aria-1 IonQ quantum computer based on trapped-ion qubits. The style-based qGAN, proposed in 2022, generalizes the state of the art for qGANs and allows for shallow-depth networks. The results obtained on both devices are of comparable quality, with the aria-1 device delivering somewhat more accurate results than the ibm_torino device, while the runtime on ibm_torino is significantly shorter than on aria-1. Parallelization of the circuits, using up to 48 qubits on IBM quantum systems and up to 24 qubits on the IonQ system, is also presented, reducing the number of submitted jobs and allowing for a substantial reduction of the runtime on the quantum processor to generate the total number of samples.",{'quantum computer': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo for systems larger than your Quantum Computer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04247v1,"Stuart Ferguson, Petros Wallden","Quantum computers theoretically promise computational advantage in many tasks, but it is much less clear how such advantage can be maintained when using existing and near-term hardware that has limitations in the number and quality of its qubits. One promising application was proposed in Layden et al [Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] where a method to reduce the thermalisation time required when sampling from hard probability distribution was introduced as a Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (QeMCMC) approach. In [Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] the size of the required quantum computer scales linearly with the problem, putting limitations on the sizes of systems that one can consider. In this work we introduce a framework to coarse grain the algorithm in such a way that the quantum computation can be performed using, multiple times, smaller quantum computers and we term the method the Coarse Grained Quantum-enhanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo (CGQeMCMC). Example strategies within this framework are put to the test, with the quantum speedup of [Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] persisting while using only $\sqrt{n}$ simulated qubits where $n$ is the number of qubits required in the original QeMCMC -- a quadratic reduction in resources. The coarse graining framework has the potential to be practically applicable in the near term as it requires very few qubits to approach classically intractable problem instances, here only 6 simulated qubits suffice to gain advantage compared to standard classical approaches when investigating the magnetisation of a 36 spin system.

Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. For massive galaxies, astronomers identify feedback from accreting supermassive black holes (active galactic nuclei, AGN) as the main agent responsible for quenching. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy at $z=3.714$ (Jekyll) and its neighborhood. Jekyll is part of a galaxy pair with a compact, dusty, massive star-forming companion (Hyde). We find large amounts of ionized and neutral gas in the intergalactic medium around the pair, yet Jekyll has remained quiescent for more than 500~Myr. The emitting gas is consistent with AGN photoionization, but no AGN is observed in Jekyll. We find that, in contrast to standard scenarios, AGN in satellite galaxies can be critical contributors for keeping massive galaxies quiescent in the early Universe.

Percolating Cosmic String loops from evaporating primordial black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03736v1,Ajit M. Srivastava,"The Pulsar timing data from NANOGrav Collaboration has regenerated interest in the possibility of observing stochastic gravitational wave background arising from cosmic strings. In the standard theory, the cosmic string network forms during spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase transition in the whole universe via the so called Kibble mechanism. This scenario would not be possible, e.g., in models of low energy inflation, where the reheat temperature is much lower than the energy scale of cosmic strings. We point out a very different possibility, where a network of even high energy scale cosmic strings can form when the temperature of the Universe is much lower. We consider local heating of plasma in the early universe by evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). It is known that for suitable masses of PBHs, their Hawking radiation may re-heat the surrounding plasma to high temperatures, restoring certain symmetries {\it locally} which are broken at the ambient temperature at that stage. Expansion of the hot plasma cools it so that the {\it locally restored symmetry} is spontaneously broken again. If this SSB supports formation of cosmic strings, then string loops will form in this region around the PBH. Further, resulting temperature gradients lead to pressure gradients such that plasma develops radial flow with the string loops getting stretched as they get dragged by the flow. For a finite density of PBHs of suitable masses, one will get local hot spots, each one contributing to expanding cosmic string loops. For suitable PBH density, the loops from different regions may intersect. Intercommutation of strings can then lead to percolation, leading to the possibility of formation of infinite string network, even when the entire universe never goes through the respective SSB phase transition.","{'black holes': 1, 'hawking radiation': 1}",05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

In fact this action term is the same functional of the emerging Vierbein e[B] as is the Einstein-Hilbert action of the Vierbein in General Relativity (GR), albeit with e[B] subject to a constraint. To solve the Einstein equations a spherically symmetric Ansatz for e[B] respecting the constraint is determined and transformed into the standard metric used to calculate the Schwarzschild solution.

Regular black holes and their relationship to polymerized models and mimetic gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03554v1,"Kristina Giesel, Hongguang Liu, Parampreet Singh, Stefan Andreas Weigl","We present further applications of the formalism introduced by the authors in arXiv:2308.10949, which allows embedding of a broad class of generalized LTB models into effective spherically symmetric spacetimes. We focus on regular black hole models, where a broad class of models can be considered, including for example LQG-inspired models as well as the model with a regular center, e.g. of Bardeen and Hayward. For a certain class of regular black hole models, we can formulate a Birkhoff-like theorem in LTB coordinates. We further show that depending on the properties of the polymerization functions characterizing such regular black hole models in this formalism, the uniqueness of the effective spherically symmetric vacuum solutions might not be given in general in Schwarzschild-like coordinates. Furthermore, we introduce a reconstruction algorithm that allows for a subclass of this models to construct from a given metric in Schwarzschild-like coordinates the corresponding effective spherically symmetric model, its dynamics as an 1+1-dimensional field theory as well as a corresponding covariant Lagrangian of extended mimetic gravity in four dimensions. Such a reconstruction allows us to obtain Lagrangians of extended mimetic gravity models for black holes with a regular center, e.g. the Bardeen and Hayward metric as well as for effective LQG inspired models. Moreover, the reconstruction enables us to extend regular black hole models to general inhomogeneous dust collapse models. For the latter, within this formalism, we can investigate and look at the physical properties of the models such as the existence of weak shell-crossing singularities from a novel perspective.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Flux-Tunable Regimes and Supersymmetry in Twisted Cuprate Heterostructures,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03454v1,"Alessandro Coppo, Luca Chirolli, Nicola Poccia, Uri Vool, Valentina Brosco","Van der Waals assembly allows for the creation of Josephson junctions in an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$ (Bi-2212) flakes that are twisted relative to each other.

In this work we investigate the physics emerging when two such junctions are integrated in a SQuID circuit threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the flowermon qubit regime is maintained up to a finite critical value of the magnetic field and, under appropriate conditions, it is protected against both charge and flux noise.

Prediction of chaotic dynamics and extreme events: A recurrence-free quantum reservoir computing approach,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03390v1,"Osama Ahmed, Felix Tennie, Luca Magri","In chaotic dynamical systems, extreme events manifest in time series as unpredictable large-amplitude peaks. Although deterministic, extreme events appear seemingly randomly, which makes their forecasting difficult. By learning the dynamics from observables (data), reservoir computers can time-accurately predict extreme events and chaotic dynamics, but they may require many degrees of freedom (large reservoirs). In this paper, by exploiting quantum-computer ansätze and entanglement, we design reservoir computers with compact reservoirs and accurate prediction capabilities. First, we propose the recurrence-free quantum reservoir computer (RF-QRC) architecture. By developing ad-hoc quantum feature maps and removing recurrent connections, the RF-QRC has quantum circuits with small depths. This allows the RF-QRC to scale well with higher-dimensional chaotic systems, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation. Second, we forecast the temporal chaotic dynamics and their long-term statistics of low- and higher-dimensional dynamical systems. We find that RF-QRC requires smaller reservoirs than classical reservoir computers. Third, we apply the RF-QRC to the time prediction of extreme events in a model of a turbulent shear flow with turbulent bursts. We find that the RF-QRC has a longer predictability than the classical reservoir computer. The results and analyses indicate that quantum-computer ansätze offer nonlinear expressivity and computational scalability, which are useful for forecasting chaotic dynamics and extreme events.

"Distance between two manifolds, topological phase transitions and scaling laws",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03323v1,"ZhaoXiang Fang, Ming Gong, Guang-Can Guo, Yongxu Fu, Long Xiong","Topological phases are generally characterized by topological invariants denoted by integer numbers. However, different topological systems often require different topological invariants to measure, such as geometric phases, topological orders, winding numbers, etc. Moreover, geometric phases and its associated definitions usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it's challenging to predict what would occur during the transformation between two different topological phases. To address these issues, in this work, we propose a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance from quantum information theory: manifold distance. This definition does not rely on the berry connection of the manifolds but rather on the information of the two manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure different topological systems (including traditional band topology models, non-Hermitian systems, and topological order models, etc.) and exhibit some universal laws during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research demonstrates that when the properties of two manifolds are identical, the distance and associated higher-order derivatives between them can smoothly transition to each other. However, for two different topological manifolds, the higher-order derivatives exhibit various divergent behaviors near the critical points. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to be generalized to real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitate the study of a wider range of physical platforms such as open systems and many-body localization.",{'quantum information theory': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Vieira","In this work, we study timelike and lightlike geodesics in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity around a black hole with the goal of constraining the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter $l$. The analysis involves studying the precession of the S2 star periastron orbiting Sgr A* and geodesic precession around the Earth. The ratio of precession frequencies for General Relativity (GR) and KR gravity is computed, with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results providing a parameter range for the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of $-0.185022 \leq l \leq 0.060938$. Utilizing the geodesic precession frequency from the Gravity Probe B (GP-B), the $l$ parameter is further constrained to $-6.30714 \times 10^{-12} \leq l \leq 3.90708 \times 10^{-12}$, which is consistent with the Schwarzschild limits. Moreover, for timelike geodesics, the innermost circular orbit (ICO) and innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) are determined and analyzed to illustrate the impact of the symmetry breaking term. Zoom-whirl obstructions are compared with the Schwarzschild solution. Lower and upper limits of the photon sphere for lightlike geodesics are established to demonstrate the influence of KR gravity on the photon sphere. Additionally, the shadow radius is determined for two observers, one situated at a finite distance from the KR black hole, and the other located at an infinite distance, to constrain the symmetry-breaking parameter $l$, with comparisons made to EHT results. The bounds for $l$ derived from constraints on the photon sphere radius for lightlike geodesics yield $-0.0700225 \leq l \leq 0.189785$ using EHT data.

Accretion Efficiency Evolution of Central Supermassive Black Holes in Quasars,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03240v1,"Arta Khosravi, Alireza Karamzadeh, Seyed Sajad Tabasi, Javad T. Firouzjaee","The ongoing debate regarding the most accurate accretion model for supermassive black holes at the center of quasars has remained a contentious issue in astrophysics. One significant challenge is the variation in calculated accretion efficiency, with values exceeding the standard range of $0.038 < ε< 0.42$. This discrepancy is especially pronounced in high redshift supermassive black holes, necessitating the development of a comprehensive model that can address the accretion efficiency for supermassive black holes in both the low and high redshift ranges. In this study, we have focused on low redshift ($z < 0.5$) PG quasars (79 quasars) and high redshift ($z \geq 3$) quasars with standard disks from the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET dataset (76 quasars) to establish a model for accretion efficiency. An interesting trend is revealed where in redshift larger than 3, accretion efficiency increases as redshift decreases, while in redshift lower than 0.5, accretion efficiency decreases with reducing redshift. This suggests a peak in accretion efficiency between the low and high redshift quasars. This peak is recognized for the flux- and volume-limited QUOTAS+QuasarNET+DL11 dataset, which is $z \sim 2.675$, and it seems to be related to the peak of the star formation rate. ($1 < z_{SFR} < 3$).

A Greedy Quantum Route-Generation Algorithm,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03054v1,Jordan Makansi,"Routing and scheduling problems with time windows have long been important optimization problems for logistics and planning. Many classical heuristics and exact methods exist for such problems. However, there are no satisfactory methods for generating routes using quantum computing (QC), for mainly two reasons: inequality constraints, and the trade-off of feasibility and solution quality. Inequality constraints are typically handled using slack variables; and feasible solutions are found by filtering samples. These challenges are amplified in the presence of noise inherent in QC. Here, we propose a greedy algorithm that generates routes by using information from all samples obtained from the quantum computer. By noticing the relationship between qubits in our formulation as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), we designed an algorithm that adaptively constructs a feasible solution.
  We prove its convergence to a feasible solution, and illustrate its efficacy by solving the Fleet Sizing Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (FSVRPTW). Our computational results show that this method obtains a lower objective value than the current state-of-the-art annealing approaches, both classical and hybrid, for the same amount of time using D-Wave Hybrid Solvers.

Dirac Brackets $\leftrightarrow$ Open Quantum Systems: A Correspondence,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02566v1,"Aleek Maity, V V Sreedhar","The time evolution of an open quantum system is governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindlad equation for the reduced density operator of the system. This operator is obtained from the full density operator of the composite system involving the system itself, the bath, and the interactions between them, by performing a partial trace over the bath degrees of freedom. The entanglement between the system and the bath leads to a generalized Liouville evolution that involves, amongst other things, dissipation and decoherence of the system.
  In a similar fashion, the time evolution of a physical observable in a classically constrained dynamical system is governed by a generalization of the Liouville equation, in which the usual Poisson bracket is replaced by the so-called Dirac bracket. The generalization takes into account the reduction in the phase space of the system because of constraints, which arise either because they are introduced by hand, or because of some underlying gauge invariance.
  We derive an intriguing, but precise classical-quantum correspondence between the aforementioned situations which connects the Lindblad operators to the constraints.

Characterizing randomness in parameterized quantum circuits through expressibility and average entanglement,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02265v1,"Guilherme Ilário Correr, Ivan Medina, Pedro C. Azado, Alexandre Drinko, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto","While scalable error correction schemes and fault tolerant quantum computing seem not to be universally accessible in the near sight, the efforts of many researchers have been directed to the exploration of the contemporary available quantum hardware. Due to these limitations, the depth and dimension of the possible quantum circuits are restricted. This motivates the study of circuits with parameterized operations that can be classically optimized in hybrid methods as variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), enabling the reduction of circuit depth and size. The characteristics of these Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) are still not fully understood outside the scope of their principal application, motivating the study of their intrinsic properties. In this work, we analyse the generation of random states in PQCs under restrictions on the qubits connectivities, justified by different quantum computer architectures. We apply the expressibility quantifier and the average entanglement as diagnostics for the characteristics of the generated states and classify the circuits depending on the topology of the quantum computer where they can be implemented. As a function of the number of layers and qubits, circuits following a Ring topology will have the highest entanglement and expressibility values, followed by Linear/All-to-all almost together and the Star topology. In addition to the characterization of the differences between the entanglement and expressibility of these circuits, we also place a connection between how steep is the increase on the uniformity of the distribution of the generated states and the generation of entanglement. Circuits generating average and standard deviation for entanglement closer to values obtained with the truly uniformly random ensemble of unitaries present a steeper evolution when compared to others.",{'quantum computer': 2},05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Liu, V. Bromm, S. Pedrosa, L. Bignone, R. Dominguez-Tenreiro","Context. Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been proposed as potential candidates for dark matter (DM) and have garnered significant attention in recent years. Aims. Our objective is to delve into the distinct impact of PBHs on gas properties and their potential role in shaping the cosmic structure. Specifically, we aim to analyze the evolving gas properties while considering the presence of accreting PBHs with varying monochromatic masses and in different quantities. By studying the feedback effects produced by this accretion, our final goal is to assess the plausibility of PBHs as candidates for DM. Methods. We develop a semi-analytical model which works on top of the CIELO hydrodynamical simulation around $z\sim23$. This model enables a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of gas properties influenced by PBHs. Our focus lies on the temperature and hydrogen abundances, placing specific emphasis on the region closest to the halo center. We explore PBH masses of $1$, $33$, and $100~\Msun$, located within mass windows where a substantial fraction of DM could exist in the form of PBHs. We investigate various DM fractions composed of these PBHs ($f_{\rm{PBH}}>10^{-4}$). Results. Our findings suggest that the existence of PBHs with masses of $1~\Msun$ and fractions greater than or equal to approximately $10^{-2}$ would be ruled out due to the significant changes induced in gas properties. The same applies to PBHs with a mass of $33~\Msun$ and $100~\Msun$ and fractions greater than approximately $10^{-3}$. These effects are particularly pronounced in the region nearest to the halo center, potentially leading to delayed galaxy formation within haloes.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Quantum Circuit Learning on NISQ Hardware,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.02069v1,"Niclas Schillo, Andreas Sturm","Current quantum computers are small and error-prone systems for which the term noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) has become established. Since large scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers are not expected to be available in the near future, the task of finding NISQ suitable algorithms has received a lot of attention in recent years. The most prominent candidates in this context are variational quantum algorithms. Due to their hybrid quantum-classical architecture they require fewer qubits and quantum gates so that they can cope with the limitations of NISQ computers. An important class of variational quantum algorithms is the quantum circuit learning (QCL) framework. Consisting of a data encoding and a trainable, parametrized layer, these schemes implement a quantum model function that can be fitted to the problem at hand. For instance, in combination with the parameter shift rule to compute derivatives, they can be used to solve differential equations. QCL and related algorithms have been widely studied in the literature. However, numerical experiments are usually limited to simulators and results from real quantum computers are scarce. In this paper we close this gap by executing QCL circuits on a superconducting IBM quantum processor in conjunction with an analysis of the hardware errors. We show that exemplary QCL circuits with up to three qubits are executable on the IBM quantum computer. For this purpose, multiple functions are learned and an exemplary differential equation is solved on the quantum computer. Moreover, we present how the QCL framework can be used to learn different quantum model functions in parallel, which can be applied to solve coupled differential equations in an efficient way.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'quantum computer': 2}",05.2024,2024,05,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Despite various examples of learning tasks with provable quantum advantages being proposed, they all involve cryptographic functions and do not represent any physical scenarios encountered in laboratory settings. In this paper we prove quantum advantages for the physically relevant task of learning quantum observables from classical (measured out) data. We consider two types of observables: first we prove a learning advantage for linear combinations of Pauli strings, then we extend the result for the broader case of unitarily parametrized observables. For each type of observable we delineate the boundaries that separate physically relevant tasks which classical computers can solve using data from quantum measurements, from those where a quantum computer is still necessary for data analysis.

Quantum Machine Learning: Quantum Kernel Methods,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01780v1,Sanjeev Naguleswaran,"Quantum algorithms based on quantum kernel methods have been investigated previously [1]. A quantum advantage is derived from the fact that it is possible to construct a family of datasets for which, only quantum processing can recognise the intrinsic labelling patterns, while for classical computers the dataset looks like noise.

The discrete log problem.is a well-known advantage of quantum vs classical computation: where it is possible to generate all the members of the group using a single mathematical operation. Kernel methods are a powerful and popular technique in classical Machine Learning. The use of a quantum feature space that can only be calculated efficiently on a quantum computer potentially allows for deriving a quantum advantage. In this paper, we intend to first describe the application of such a kernel method to a Quantum version of the classical Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm to identify conditions under which, a quantum advantage is realised. A data dependent projected quantum kernel was shown to provide significant advantage over classical kernels.

"Spectral form factor in chaotic, localized, and integrable open quantum many-body systems",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01641v1,"Jiachen Li, Stephen Yan, Tomaž Prosen, Amos Chan","We numerically study the spectral statistics of open quantum many-body systems (OQMBS) as signatures of quantum chaos (or the lack thereof), using the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF), a generalization of the spectral form factor to complex spectra. We show that the DSFF of chaotic OQMBS generically displays the $\textit{quadratic}$ ramp-plateau behaviour of the Ginibre ensemble from random matrix theory, in contrast to the linear ramp-plateau behaviour of the Gaussian ensemble in closed quantum systems. Furthermore, in the presence of many-body interactions, such RMT behaviour emerges only after a time scale $τ_{\mathrm{dev}}$, which generally increases with system size for sufficiently large system size, and can be identified as the non-Hermitian analogue of the $\textit{many-body Thouless time}$. The universality of the random matrix theory behavior is demonstrated by surveying twelve models of OQMBS, including random Kraus circuits (quantum channels) and random Lindbladians (Liouvillians) in several symmetry classes, as well as Lindbladians of paradigmatic models such as the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), XXZ, and the transverse field Ising models. We devise an unfolding and filtering procedure to remove variations of the averaged density of states which would otherwise hide the universal RMT-like signatures in the DSFF for chaotic OQMBS. Beyond chaotic OQMBS, we study the spectral statistics of non-chaotic OQMBS, specifically the integrable XX model and a system in the many-body localized (MBL) regime in the presence of dissipation, which exhibit DSFF behaviours distinct from the ramp-plateau behaviour of random matrix theory. Lastly, we study the DSFF of Lindbladians with the Hamiltonian term set to zero, i.e. only the jump operators are present, and demonstrate that the results of RMT universality and scaling of many-body Thouless time survive even without coherent evolution.",{'quantum chaos': 1},05.2024,2024,05,[]
A hidden population of active galactic nuclei can explain the overabundance of luminous $z&gt;10$ objects observed by JWST,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01629v1,"Sahil Hegde, Michael M. Wyatt, Steven R. Furlanetto","The first wave of observations with JWST has revealed a striking overabundance of luminous galaxies at early times ($z>10$) compared to models of galaxies calibrated to pre-JWST data. Early observations have also uncovered a large population of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z>6$. Because many of the high-$z$ objects appear extended, the contribution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the total luminosity has been assumed to be negligible. In this work, we use a semi-empirical model for assigning AGNs to galaxies to show that active galaxies can boost the stellar luminosity function (LF) enough to solve the overabundance problem while simultaneously remaining consistent with the observed morphologies of high-$z$ sources. We construct a model for the composite AGN+galaxy LF by connecting dark matter halo masses to galaxy and SMBH masses and luminosities, accounting for dispersion in the mapping between host galaxy and SMBH mass and luminosity. By calibrating the model parameters -- which characterize the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ relation -- to a compilation of $z>10$ JWST UVLF data, we show that AGN emission can account for the excess luminosity under a variety of scenarios, including one where 10\% of galaxies host BHs of comparable luminosities to their stellar components. Using a sample of simulated objects and real observations, we demonstrate that such low-luminosity AGNs can be `hidden' in their host galaxies and be missed in common morphological analyses. We find that for this explanation to be viable, our model requires a population of BHs that are overmassive ($M_\bullet/M_\star\sim10^{-2}$) with respect to their host galaxies compared to the local relation and are more consistent with the observed relation at $z=4-8$. We explore the implications of this model for BH seed properties and comment on observational diagnostics necessary to further investigate this explanation.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
The Binary Black Hole Merger Rate Deviates From the Cosmic Star Formation Rate: A Tug of War Between Metallicity and Delay Times,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01623v1,"Adam Boesky, Floor S. Broekgaarden, Edo Berger","Gravitational-wave detectors are now making it possible to investigate how the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) evolves with redshift. In this study, we examine whether the BBH merger rate of isolated binaries deviates from a scaled star formation rate density (SFRD) -- a frequently used model in state-of-the-art research. To address this question, we conduct population synthesis simulations using COMPAS with a grid of stellar evolution models, calculate their cosmological merger rates, and compare them to a scaled SFRD. We find that our simulated rates deviate by factors up to $3.5\times$ at $z\sim0$ and $5\times$ at $z\sim 9$ due to two main phenomena: (i) The formation efficiency of BBHs is an order of magnitude higher at low metallicities than at solar metallicity; and (ii) BBHs experience a wide range of delays (from a few Myr to many Gyr) between formation and merger. Deviations are similar when comparing to a $\textit{delayed}$ SFRD, and even larger (up to $\sim 10\times$) when comparing to SFRD-based models scaled to the local merger rate. Interestingly, our simulations find that the BBH delay time distribution is redshift-dependent, increasing the complexity of the redshift distribution of mergers. We find similar results for simulated merger rates of BHNSs and BNSs. We conclude that the rate of BBH, BHNS, and BNS mergers from the isolated channel can significantly deviate from a scaled SFRD, and that future measurements of the merger rate will provide insights into the formation pathways of gravitational-wave sources.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We extracted the quasi-periodic oscillation properties by model fitting the power density spectrum and from those properties we designate that the QPOs are type-C in nature. We also conclude that the origin of the QPOs could be the shock instabilities in the transonic advective accretion flows around black holes. The spectral analysis was performed using simultaneous data from the three on-board instruments LE, ME, and HE of \textit{Insight-HXMT} in the broad energy band of $2-150 $ keV. To achieve the best fit, spectral fitting required a combination of models e.g. interstellar absorption, power-law, multi-color disk-blackbody continuum, gaussian emission/absorption, and reflection by neutral material.

Saturation of the Multiparameter Quantum Cramér-Rao Bound at the Single-Copy Level with Projective Measurements,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01471v1,Hendra I. Nurdin,"Quantum parameter estimation theory is an important component of quantum information theory and provides the statistical foundation that underpins important topics such as quantum system identification and quantum waveform estimation. When there is more than one parameter the ultimate precision in the mean square error given by the quantum Cramér-Rao bound is not necessarily achievable. For non-full rank quantum states, it was not known when this bound can be saturated (achieved) when only a single copy of the quantum state encoding the unknown parameters is available. This single-copy scenario is important because of its experimental/practical tractability. Recently, necessary and sufficient conditions for saturability of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound in the multiparameter single-copy scenario have been established in terms of i) the commutativity of a set of projected symmetric logarithmic derivatives and ii) the existence of a unitary solution to a system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. New sufficient conditions were also obtained that only depend on properties of the symmetric logarithmic derivatives. In this paper, key structural properties of optimal measurements that saturate the quantum Cramér-Rao bound are illuminated. These properties are exploited to i) show that the sufficient conditions are in fact necessary and sufficient for an optimal measurement to be projective, ii) give an alternative proof of previously established necessary conditions, and iii) describe general POVMs, not necessarily projective, that saturate the multiparameter QCRB.

Continuous-variable quantum kernel method on a programmable photonic quantum processor,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01086v1,"Keitaro Anai, Shion Ikehara, Yoshichika Yano, Daichi Okuno, Shuntaro Takeda","Among various quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, the quantum kernel method has especially attracted attention due to its compatibility with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and its potential to achieve quantum advantage. This method performs classification and regression by nonlinearly mapping data into quantum states in a higher dimensional Hilbert space. Thus far, the quantum kernel method has been implemented only on qubit-based systems, but continuous-variable (CV) systems can potentially offer superior computational power by utilizing its infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Here, we demonstrate the implementation of the classification task with the CV quantum kernel method on a programmable photonic quantum processor. We experimentally prove that the CV quantum kernel method successfully classifies several datasets robustly even under the experimental imperfections, with high accuracies comparable to the classical kernel.

Mass segregation and velocity dispersion as evidence for a dark star cluster,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00775v1,"Wenjie Wu, Pavel Kroupa, Jan Pflamm-Altenburg","A dark star cluster (DSC) is a system in which the cluster potential is dominated by stellar remnants, such as black holes and neutron stars having larger masses than the long-lived low-mass stars. Due to mass segregation, these remnants are located in the central region of the cluster and form a dark core. We expect that at a few kpc from the Galactic centre, the efficient evaporation of the lower-mass stars caused by the strong tidal force exposes the dark core, because the dynamical properties of the DSC are dominated by the remnants. Due to the invisibility of the remnants, finding a DSC by observation is challenging. In this project, we use $N$-body simulations to obtain models of DSCs and try to discern observables that signify a DSC. We consider four observables: the mass spectrum, the observational mass density profile, the observational velocity dispersion profile and the mass segregation. The models show that a DSC typically exhibits two distinct characteristics: for a given mass in stars and a given half-light radius the expected velocity dispersion is underestimated when only visible stars are considered, and there is a lack of measurable mass segregation among the stars. These properties can be helpful for finding DSCs in observational data, such as the Gaia catalogue.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum-Classical Separations in Shallow-Circuit-Based Learning with and without Noises,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00770v1,"Zhihan Zhang, Weiyuan Gong, Weikang Li, Dong-Ling Deng","We study quantum-classical separations between classical and quantum supervised learning models based on constant depth (i.e., shallow) circuits, in scenarios with and without noises. We construct a classification problem defined by a noiseless shallow quantum circuit and rigorously prove that any classical neural network with bounded connectivity requires logarithmic depth to output correctly with a larger-than-exponentially-small probability. This unconditional near-optimal quantum-classical separation originates from the quantum nonlocality property that distinguishes quantum circuits from their classical counterparts. We further derive the noise thresholds for demonstrating such a separation on near-term quantum devices under the depolarization noise model. We prove that this separation will persist if the noise strength is upper bounded by an inverse polynomial with respect to the system size, and vanish if the noise strength is greater than an inverse polylogarithmic function.

  Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact.

Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices.

In the limit, we also find that an infinite tower of primary operators emerges without a gap above the vacuum and that the conformal field theory becomes locally a tensor product of a sigma-model in the large radius limit and a compact theory. As a corollary, we establish a part of the Distance Conjecture about gravitational theories in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. In particular, our bounds on $α$ indicate that the emergence of exponentially light particles is inevitable as the moduli field corresponding to $t$ rolls beyond the Planck scale along the steepest path and that this phenomenon can begin already at the curvature scale of the bulk geometry.",{'bulk geometry': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Holography']

This diversity already suggests the potential for varied applications, as well as acting as a bridge between different domains. Here we devise new quantum subroutines to efficiently prepare quantum unitary operators that embed the standard matrix geometric mean and its generalisations called the weighted matrix geometric mean. This enables the construction of solutions to the algebraic Riccati equation, which is an important class of nonlinear systems of equations that appears in machine learning, optimal control, estimation, and filtering. Using these subroutines, we present a new class of quantum learning algorithms called quantum geometric mean metric learning. This has applications in efficiently finding the best distance measure and solving classification problems in the weakly supervised limit and for anomaly detection, for both classical and quantum problems. We also show how our method can be generalised to a particular p^th-order system of nonlinear equations. These quantum subroutines for matrix geometric means are also useful in other areas of quantum information. For example, we show how to use them in the estimation of geometric Renyi relative entropies and the Uhlmann fidelity by means of the Fuchs-Caves observable. In particular, our quantum algorithms for estimating the Uhlmann and Matsumoto fidelities have optimal dependence on the precision.

Tomography of flavoured leptogenesis with primordial blue gravitational waves,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00641v1,"Marco Chianese, Satyabrata Datta, Rome Samanta, Ninetta Saviano","We explore a scenario where an early epoch of matter domination is driven by the mass scale $M_N$ of the right-handed neutrinos, which also characterizes the different flavour regimes of leptogenesis. Such a matter-domination epoch gives rise to peculiar spectral imprints on primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during inflation. We point out that the characteristic spectral features are detectable in multiple frequency bands with current and future GW experiments in case of Blue GWs (BGWs) described by a power-law with a positive spectral index $(n_T >0)$ and an amplitude compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements. We find that the three-flavour leptogenesis regime with $M_N \lesssim 10^9~{\rm GeV}$ imprints BGWs more prominently than the two-flavour and one-flavour regimes characterized by a higher right-neutrino mass scale. In particular, a two-flavour (three-flavour) leptogenesis regime is expected to leave distinct imprints in the mHz ($μ$Hz) band. Moreover, we translate the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and LIGO limits on the GW energy density into constraints on the flavour leptogenesis parameter space for different GW spectral index $n_T$. Interestingly, a three-flavour leptogenesis regime can offer a unique signal testable in the next LIGO run with a correlated signature in the PTA frequency band with an amplitude comparable to the one expected from supermassive black holes.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

Pure State Inspired Lossless Post-selected Quantum Metrology of Mixed States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00405v1,Jing Yang,"Given an ensemble of identical pure quantum states that depend on an unknown parameter, recently it was shown that the quantum Fisher information can be losslessly compressed into a subensemble with a much smaller number of samples. However, generalization to mixed states leads to a technical challenge that is formidable to overcome directly. In this work, we avoid such technicality by unveiling the physics of a featured lossless post-selection measurement: while the post-selected quantum state is unchanged, the parametric derivative of the density operator is amplified by a large factor equal to the square root of the inverse of the post-selection success probability. This observation not only clarifies the intuition and essence of post-selected quantum metrology but also allows us to develop a mathematically compact theory for the lossless post-selection of mixed states. We find that if the parametric derivative of the density operator of a mixed state, or alternatively the symmetric logarithmic derivative, vanishes on the support of the density matrix, lossless post-selection can be achieved with an arbitrarily large amplification factor. We exemplify with the examples of superresolution imaging and unitary encoding of mixed initial states.

Using the morphological catalog of 3965 visually classified JWST galaxies from Ferreira et al. (2023), we investigate the evolution of stars, and when they form, as a function of morphological type as well as galaxies classified as passive and starburst through spectral energy distributions. Although disk galaxies dominate the structures of galaxies at $z < 7$, we find that these disks are in general either `passive', or on the main-sequence of star formation, and do not contain a large population of starburst galaxies. We also find no significant correlation between morphological type and the star formation rate or colours of galaxies at $z < 7$. In fact, we find that the morphologically classified `spheroids' tend to be blue and are not found to be predominately passive systems at $z > 1.5$. We also find that the stellar mass function for disk galaxies does not evolve significantly during this time, whereas other galaxy types, such as the peculiar population, evolve dramatically, declining at lower redshifts. This indicates that massive peculiars are more common at higher redshifts. We further find that up to $z \sim 7$, the specific star formation rate (sSFR) does not vary with visual morphology, but strongly depends on stellar mass and internal galaxy mass density. This demonstrates that at early epochs galaxy assembly is a mass-driven, rather than a morphologically-driven, process. Quenching of star formation is therefore a mass-dominated process throughout the universe's history, likely due to the presence of supermassive black holes.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']
Migration of Accreting Planets and Black Holes in Disks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00296v1,"JT Laune, Rixin Li, Dong Lai","Nascent planets are thought to lose angular momentum (AM) to the gaseous protoplanetary disk (PPD) via gravitational interactions, leading to inward migration. A similar migration process also applies to stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in AGN disks. However, AM exchange via accretion onto the planet/BH may strongly influence the migration torque. In this study, we perform 2D global hydrodynamic simulations of an accreting planet/BH embedded in a disk, where AM exchange between the planet/BH and disk via gravity, accretion, pressure and viscosity are considered. When accretion is turned off, we recover the linear estimate for Type I migration torque. However, in all of our accreting simulations, we find outward migration due to the positive AM deposited onto the accreting body by the disk gas. Our simulations achieve the global steady state for the transport of mass and AM: The mass and AM fluxes are constant across the disk except for jumps ($Δ\dot M$ and $Δ\dot J$) at the planet's location, and the jumps match the accretion rate and torque on the planet. Our findings suggest that extra caution is needed when applying the standard results of disk migration to accreting planets and BHs.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

We discuss the inability of the Newtonian gauge to describe perturbations in contracting models as the perturbative hypothesis does not hold in such cases.

The simplest interpretation is that the companions are dormant neutron stars (NSs), though ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs) and tight WD+WD binaries cannot be fully excluded. We selected targets from Gaia DR3 astrometric binary solutions in which the luminous star is on the main sequence and the dynamically-implied mass of the unseen companion is (a) more than $1.25\,M_{\odot}$ and (b) too high to be any non-degenerate star or close binary. We obtained multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) over a period of 650 days, spanning a majority of the orbits' dynamic range in RV. The RVs broadly validate the astrometric solutions and significantly tighten constraints on companion masses. Several systems have companion masses that are unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit, while the rest have masses between 1.25 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The orbits are significantly more eccentric at fixed period than those of typical WD + MS binaries, perhaps due to natal kicks. Metal-poor stars are overrepresented in the sample: 3 out of 21 objects (14%) have [Fe/H]$\sim-1.5$ and are on halo orbits, compared to $\sim 0.5\%$ of the parent Gaia binary sample. The metal-poor stars are all strongly enhanced in lithium. The formation history of these objects is puzzling: it is unclear both how the binaries escaped a merger or dramatic orbital shrinkage when the NS progenitors were red supergiants, and how they remained bound when the NSs formed. Gaia has now discovered 3 black holes (BHs) in astrometric binaries with masses above 9 $M_{\odot}$, and 21 NSs with masses near $1.4\,M_{\odot}$.

Mishra, and Max Wiesner","We study universal features of the density of one-particle states $ρ(E)$ in weakly coupled theories of gravity at energies above the quantum gravity cutoff $Λ$, defined as the scale suppressing higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein--Hilbert action. Using thermodynamic properties of black holes, we show that in asymptotically flat spacetimes, certain features of $ρ(E)$ above the black hole threshold $M_{\rm min}$ are an indicator for the existence of large extra dimensions, and cannot be reproduced by any lower-dimensional field theory with finitely many fields satisfying the weak energy condition. Based on the properties of gravitational scattering amplitudes, we argue that there needs to exist a (possibly higher-dimensional) effective description of gravity valid up to the cutoff $Λ$. Combining this with thermodynamic arguments we demonstrate that $ρ(E)$ has to grow exponentially for energies $Λ\ll E \ll M_{\rm min}$. Furthermore we show that the tension of any weakly coupled $p$-brane with $p\geq 1$ is bounded from below by $Λ^{p-1}$. We use this to argue that any tower of weakly coupled states with mass below $Λ$ has to be a Kaluza--Klein (KK) tower. Altogether these results indicate that in gravitational weak-coupling limits the lightest tower of states is either a KK tower, or has an exponentially growing degeneracy thereby resembling a string tower. This provides evidence for the Emergent String Conjecture without explicitly relying on string theory or supersymmetry.",{'black holes': 1},05.2024,2024,05,['Black Holes and GR']

A simple method for compiling quantum stabilizer circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19408v1,Brendan Reid,"Stabilizer circuits play an important role in quantum error correction protocols, and will be vital for ensuring fault tolerance in future quantum hardware. While stabilizer circuits are defined on the Clifford generating set, {H, S, CX}, not all of these gates are native to quantum hardware. As such they must be compiled into the native gateset, with the key difference across hardware archetypes being the native two qubit gate. Here we introduce an intuitive and accessible method for Clifford gate compilation. While multiple open source solutions exist for quantum circuit compilation, these operate on arbitrary quantum gates. By restricting ourselves to Clifford gates, the compilation process becomes almost trivial and even large circuits can be compiled manually. The core idea is well known: if two Clifford circuits conjugate Paulis identically, they are equivalent. Compilation is then reduced to ensuring that the instantaneous Pauli conjugation is correct for each qubit at every timestep. This is Tableaux Manipulation, so called as we directly interrogate stabilizer tableaux to ensure correct Pauli conjugation. We provide a brief explanation of the process along with some worked examples to build intuition; we finally show some comparisons for compiling large circuits to open source software, and highlight that this method ensures a minimal number of quantum gates are employed.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Revealing the working mechanism of quantum neural networks by mutual information,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19312v1,"Xin Zhang, Yuexian Hou","Quantum neural networks (QNNs) is a parameterized quantum circuit model, which can be trained by gradient-based optimizer, can be used for supervised learning, regression tasks, combinatorial optimization, etc. Although many works have demonstrated that QNNs have better learnability, generalizability, etc. compared to classical neural networks. However, as with classical neural networks, we still can't explain their working mechanism well. In this paper, we reveal the training mechanism of QNNs by mutual information. Unlike traditional mutual information in neural networks, due to quantum computing remains information conserved, the mutual information is trivial of the input and output of U operator. In our work, in order to observe the change of mutual information during training, we divide the quantum circuit (U operator) into two subsystems, discard subsystem (D) and measurement subsystem (M) respectively. We calculate two mutual information, I(Di : Mo) and I(Mi : Mo) (i and o means input or output of the corresponding subsystem), and observe their behavior during training. As the epochs increases, I(Di : Mo) gradually increases, this may means some information of discard subsystem is continuously pushed into the measurement subsystem, the information should be label-related. What's more, I(Mi : Mo) exist two-phase behavior in training process, this consistent with the information bottleneck anticipation. The first phase, I(Mi : Mo) is increasing, this means the measurement subsystem perform feature fitting. The second phase, I(Mi : Mo) is decreasing, this may means the system is generalizing, the measurement subsystem discard label-irrelevant information into the discard subsystem as many as possible.

The signal-idler and idler-free protocols are explored to determine the position of the target Unruh channel within a sequence of background channels. We derive the fidelity-based bounds for the ultimate error probability of each strategy and obtain the conditions where the signal-idler protocol is superior to the protocol involving idler-free states. It is found that the lower bound of the error probability for the signal-idler scheme exhibits clear advantages in all cases, while the idler-free scheme can only be implemented when the temperature of the two channels is very close and the number of initial states is insufficient.

The FermiML framework allows for building fermionic counterparts of any quantum machine learning (QML) model based on parameterized quantum circuits, including models that produce highly entangled quantum states. Importantly, matchgate circuits are efficiently simulable classically, thus rendering FermiML a flexible framework for utility benchmarks of QML methods on large real-world datasets. We initiate the exploration of FermiML by benchmarking it against unrestricted PQCs in the context of classification with random quantum kernels.

Better Optimization of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers by combining the Unitary Block Optimization Scheme with Classical Post-Processing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19027v3,"Xiaochuan Ding, Bryan K. Clark","Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQE) are a promising approach for finding the classically intractable ground state of a Hamiltonian. The Unitary Block Optimization Scheme (UBOS) is a state-of-the-art VQE method which works by sweeping over gates and finding optimal parameters for each gate in the environment of other gates. UBOS improves the convergence time to the ground state by an order of magnitude over Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). It nonetheless suffers in both rate of convergence and final converged energies in the face of highly noisy expectation values coming from shot noise. Here we develop two classical post-processing techniques which improve UBOS especially when measurements have large noise. Using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), we generate artificial augmented data using original data from the quantum computer to reduce the overall error when solving for the improved parameters. Using Double Robust Optimization plus Rejection (DROPR), we prevent outlying data which are atypically noisy from resulting in a particularly erroneous single optimization step thereby increasing robustness against noisy measurements. Combining these techniques further reduces the final relative error that UBOS reaches by a factor of three without adding additional quantum measurement or sampling overhead. This work further demonstrates that developing techniques which use classical resources to post-process quantum measurement results can significantly improve VQE algorithms.",{'quantum computer': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Sign problem in tensor network contraction,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19023v1,"Jielun Chen, Jiaqing Jiang, Dominik Hangleiter, Norbert Schuch","We investigate how the computational difficulty of contracting tensor networks depends on the sign structure of the tensor entries. Using results from computational complexity, we observe that the approximate contraction of tensor networks with only positive entries has lower complexity. This raises the question how this transition in computational complexity manifests itself in the hardness of different contraction schemes. We pursue this question by studying random tensor networks with varying bias towards positive entries. First, we consider contraction via Monte Carlo sampling, and find that the transition from hard to easy occurs when the entries become predominantly positive; this can be seen as a tensor network manifestation of the Quantum Monte Carlo sign problem. Second, we analyze the commonly used contraction based on boundary tensor networks. Its performance is governed by the amount of correlations (entanglement) in the tensor network. Remarkably, we find that the transition from hard to easy (i.e., from a volume law to a boundary law scaling of entanglement) occurs already for a slight bias towards a positive mean, and the earlier the larger the bond dimension is. This is in contrast to both expectations and the behavior found in Monte Carlo contraction. We gain further insight into this early transition from the study of an effective statmech model. Finally, we investigate the computational difficulty of computing expectation values of tensor network wavefunctions, i.e., PEPS, where we find that the complexity of entanglement-based contraction always remains low. We explain this by providing a local transformation which maps PEPS expectation values to a positive-valued tensor network. This not only provides insight into the origin of the observed boundary law entanglement scaling, but also suggests new approaches towards PEPS contraction based on positive decompositions.","{'tensor network': 4, 'tensor networks': 4}",04.2024,2024,04,['Tensor Networks']
Topological holography for fermions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19004v1,"Rui Wen, Weicheng Ye, Andrew C. Potter","Topological holography is a conjectured correspondence between the symmetry charges and defects of a $D$-dimensional system with the anyons in a $(D+1)$-dimensional topological order: the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). Topological holography is conjectured to capture the topological aspects of symmetry in gapped and gapless systems, with different phases corresponding to different gapped boundaries (anyon condensations) of the SymTFT. This correspondence was previously considered primarily for bosonic systems, excluding many phases of condensed matter systems involving fermionic electrons. In this work, we extend the SymTFT framework to establish a topological holography correspondence for fermionic systems. We demonstrate that this fermionic SymTFT framework captures the known properties of $1+1D$ fermion gapped phases and critical points, including the classification, edge-modes, and stacking rules of fermionic symmetry-protected topological phases (SPTs), and computation of partition functions of fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs).

These bound states closely resemble the Schwarzschild geometry from the asymptotic region up to an infinitesimal distance away from the Schwarzschild horizon. Below this scale, the horizon is replaced by novel spacetime structures supported by intense and entrapped electromagnetic flux. The flux originates from collinear black holes that can be brought arbitrarily close to extremality. We find that the charge distribution follows a universal pattern, with magnitudes scaling proportionally to the total mass and alternating in sign. Moreover, the bound states always have an entropy that constitutes a fraction of the Schwarzschild entropy. Constructed in four dimensions, the black holes are kept apart by struts, for which we analyze tensions and energies.

Quantum Field Theory of Black Hole Perturbations with Backreaction: I. General framework,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18956v1,Thomas Thiemann,"In a seminal work, Hawking showed that natural states for free quantum matter fields on classical spacetimes that solve the spherically symmetric vacuum Einstein equations are KMS states of non-vanishing temperature. Although Hawking's calculation does not include backreaction of matter on geometry, it is more than plausible that the corresponding Hawking radiation leads to black hole evaporation which is in principle observable.
  Obviously, an improvement of Hawking's calculation including backreaction is a problem of quantum gravity. Since no commonly accepted quantum field theory of general relativity is available yet, it has been difficult to reliably derive the backreaction effect. An obvious approach is to use black hole perturbation theory of a Schwarzschild black hole of fixed mass and to quantise those perturbations. But it is not clear how to reconcile perturbation theory with gauge invariance beyond linear perturbations.
  In a recent work we proposed a new approach to this problem that applies when the physical situation has an approximate symmetry, such as homogeneity (cosmology), spherical symmetry (Schwarzschild) or axial symmetry (Kerr). The idea, which is surprisingly feasible, is to first construct the non-perturbative physical (reduced) Hamiltonian of the reduced phase space of fully gauge invariant observables and only then to apply perturbation theory directly in terms of observables. The task to construct observables is then disentangled from perturbation theory, thus allowing to unambiguosly develop perturbation theory to arbitrary orders.
  In this first paper of the the series we outline and showcase this approach for spherical symmetry and second order in the perturbations for Einstein-Klein-Gordon-Maxwell theory.

In this work we present a suite of 28 new numerical relativity simulations of eccentric, aligned-spin binary black holes with mass ratios between 1 and 6 and initial post-Newtonian eccentricities between 0.05 and 0.3. We then develop a robust pipeline for measuring the eccentricity evolution as a function of frequency from gravitational-wave observables that is applicable even to signals that span at least $\gtrsim 7$ orbits. We assess the reliability of our procedure and quantify its robustness under different assumptions on the data. Using the eccentricity measured at the first apastron, we initialise effective-one-body waveforms and quantify how the precision in the eccentricity measurement, and therefore the choice of the initial conditions, impacts the agreement with the numerical data. We find that even small deviations in the initial eccentricity can lead to non-negligible differences in the phase and amplitude of the waveforms.

RMPS represent a generalization of random product states featuring bounded entanglement that scales logarithmically with the bond dimension $χ$. We demonstrate that the $2$-Stabilizer Rényi Entropy converges to that of Haar random states as $N/χ^2$, where $N$ is the system size. This indicates that MPS with a modest bond dimension are as magical as generic states. Subsequently, we introduce the ensemble of Clifford enhanced Matrix Product States ($\mathcal{C}$MPS), built by the action of Clifford unitaries on RMPS. Leveraging our previous result, we show that $\mathcal{C}$MPS can approximate $4$-spherical designs with arbitrary accuracy.

Mavromatos, Panagiotis Dorlis, Sotirios-Neilos Vlachos","We discuss the role of torsion in string theory on inducing pseudoscalar degrees of freedom (axions), which in turn couple to (gravitational) Chern-Simons (CS) anomalous terms. Such interactions can induce inflation, of running vacuum type, not requiring external inflaton fields, through condensation of the anomalous terms as a consequence of primordial chiral gravitational-wave (GW) tensor perturbations in a weak-quantum gravity setting. The presence of an UV cutoff for the GW quantum graviton modes opens up the system, leading to a dissipative behaviour realised via the presence of non trivial imaginary parts of the gravitational CS terms. The naive estimate of the life time of inflation based on such imaginary parts, which afflict the pertinent GW Hamiltonian, is quite consistent with the estimates of the duration of inflation based on an analysis of the condensate-induced linear-axion-potential by means of dynamical systems. Such quantum-gravity effects can also contribute positively to the alleviation of cosmological tensions if they survive today. In the talk we discuss the conditions under which such a result may be achieved. We also discuss the potential role of other axions in string theory, coming from compactification, in inducing enhanced densities of primordial black holes during RVM inflation, thereby contributing to significantly increased percentages of these black holes that can play the role of dark matter components. Moreover, under certain circumstances, that we shall discuss in some detail, it is also possible that the initially massless torsion-induced axions can acquire a non-trivial mass during the radiation era, thereby providing additional dark matter components in the Universe.

In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, makes it possible to realize scalable numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the choice of the separation into finite regions of clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on the correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We also compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those of a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in a short time region, where the energy is well conserved in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it can be potentially applied to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems even in higher dimensions.",{'tensor network': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Tensor Networks']

Even the infinite $f_{\rm NL}$ limit is insufficiently non-Gaussian but much higher-order non-Gaussianity of the form ${\cal R}={\cal R}_{\rm G}^5$ may allow the formation of any mass primordial black hole without conflicting with distortion constraints.

Spectral distortions from acoustic dissipation with non-Gaussian (or not) perturbations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18474v1,"Devanshu Sharma, Julien Lesgourgues, Christian T. Byrnes","A well-known route to form primordial black holes in the early universe relies on the existence of unusually large primordial curvature fluctuations, confined to a narrow range of wavelengths that would be too small to be constrained by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies. This scenario would however boost the generation of $μ$-type spectral distortions in the CMB due to an enhanced dissipation of acoustic waves. Previous studies of $μ$-distortion bounds on the primordial spectrum were based on the assumptions of Gaussian primordial fluctuations. In this work, we push the calculation of $μ$-distortions to one higher order in photon anisotropies. We discuss how to derive bounds on primordial spectrum peaks obeying non-Gaussian statistics under the assumption of local (perturbative or not) non-Gaussianity. We find that, depending on the value of the peak scale, the bounds may either remain stable or get tighter by several orders of magnitude, but only when the departure from Gaussian statistics is very strong.

Equivalence Checking of Parameterised Quantum Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18456v1,"Xin Hong, Wei-Jia Huang, Wei-Chen Chien, Yuan Feng, Min-Hsiu Hsieh, Sanjiang Li, Mingsheng Ying","Parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs) hold great promise for demonstrating quantum advantages in practical applications of quantum computation. Examples of successful applications include the variational quantum eigensolver, the quantum approximate optimisation algorithm, and quantum machine learning. However, before executing PQCs on real quantum devices, they undergo compilation and optimisation procedures. Given the inherent error-proneness of these processes, it becomes crucial to verify the equivalence between the original PQC and its compiled or optimised version. Unfortunately, most existing quantum circuit verifiers cannot directly handle parameterised quantum circuits; instead, they require parameter substitution to perform verification.
  In this paper, we address the critical challenge of equivalence checking for PQCs. We propose a novel compact representation for PQCs based on tensor decision diagrams. Leveraging this representation, we present an algorithm for verifying PQC equivalence without the need for instantiation. Our approach ensures both effectiveness and efficiency, as confirmed by experimental evaluations. The decision-diagram representations offer a powerful tool for analysing and verifying parameterised quantum circuits, bridging the gap between theoretical models and practical implementations.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'quantum machine learning': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The subgroups of $S_{n}$ arise, among many other contexts, to describe label symmetry of classical images with respect to spatial transformations, e.g. reflection or rotation. Equipped with the formalism of geometric quantum machine learning, in this work we propose the architectures of equivariant quantum convolutional neural networks (EQCNNs) adherent to $S_{n}$ and its subgroups. We demonstrate that a careful choice of pixel-to-qubit embedding order can facilitate easy construction of EQCNNs for small subgroups of $S_{n}$. Our novel EQCNN architecture corresponding to the full permutation group $S_{n}$ is built by applying all possible QCNNs with equal probability, which can also be conceptualized as a dropout strategy in quantum neural networks. For subgroups of $S_{n}$, our numerical results using MNIST datasets show better classification accuracy than non-equivariant QCNNs. The $S_{n}$-equivariant QCNN architecture shows significantly improved training and test performance than non-equivariant QCNN for classification of connected and non-connected graphs.

In this context, one of the main goals of quantum circuit complexity is to find problems that can be solved by quantum shallow circuits but require more computational resources classically.
  Our first contribution in this work is to prove new separations between classical and quantum constant-depth circuits. Firstly, we show a separation between constant-depth quantum circuits with quantum advice $\mathsf{QNC}^0/\mathsf{qpoly}$, and $\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$, which is the class of classical constant-depth circuits with unbounded-fan in and $\pmod{p}$ gates. In addition, we show a separation between $\mathsf{QAC}^0$, which additionally has Toffoli gates with unbounded control, and $\mathsf{AC}^0[p]$. This establishes the first such separation for a shallow-depth quantum class that does not involve quantum fan-out gates.
  Secondly, we consider $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits with infinite-size gate sets. We show that these circuits, along with (classical or quantum) prime modular gates, can implement threshold gates, showing that $\mathsf{QNC}^0[p]=\mathsf{QTC}^0$. Finally, we also show that in the infinite-size gateset case, these quantum circuit classes for higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces do not offer any advantage to standard qubit implementations.",{'quantum circuit': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Afshar, Saeed Noori Gashti, Mohammad Reza Alipour","We explore free energy landscapes for black holes influenced by 'dark' structure, assessing how additional parameters affect escape and transition rates during phase transitions. In our dual-perspective analysis, we first consider the Kramers' rate as a function of the black hole radius. From this viewpoint, the escape rate from smaller to larger black holes will consistently be greater than the reverse. From the second perspective, we consider the escape rate as a function of temperature (pressure). In both models under study, initially, the behavior of the probability diagrams is akin to the radius-based behavior. However, with an increase in temperature (and corresponding pressure), we reach a specific and distinct point, where the systems will move towards either smaller or larger black holes with the same probability. Beyond this temperature (pressure), the behavior of the models diverges. In the nonlinear model, an inversion occurs where the escape rate from larger black holes to smaller ones becomes predominant. This inversion area seems to be significantly reduced compared to the charged black hole model, although it is still discernible in the temperature-based escape rate diagram. In other words, within the temperature range studied, where the likelihood of radiative conditions and movement from a large black hole to a small black hole is less, It seems that the addition of dark parameters minimizes the occurrence of this transition, indicating the subtle influence of dark structures on the phase transition dynamics between black holes. In the string model, although the trend of increasing pressure in the transition from a large black hole to a smaller one is greater than the reverse, it seems that the transition process from a small black hole to a larger one, with decreasing pressure, completely prevents the 'low probable' transition from a large black hole to a smaller one.",{'black holes': 5},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Shimwell, Andrea Botteon","Giant radio galaxies (GRGs, giant RGs, or giants) are megaparsec-scale, jet-driven outflows from accretion disks of supermassive black holes, and represent the most extreme pathway by which galaxies can impact the Cosmic Web around them. A long-standing but unresolved question is why giants are so much larger than other radio galaxies. It has been proposed that, in addition to having higher jet powers than most RGs, giants might live in especially low-density Cosmic Web environments. In this work, we aim to test this hypothesis by pinpointing Local Universe giants and other RGs in physically principled, Bayesian large-scale structure reconstructions. More specifically, we localised a LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2-dominated sample of luminous ($l_ν(ν= 150\ \mathrm{MHz}) \geq 10^{24}\ \mathrm{W\ Hz^{-1}}$) giants and a control sample of LoTSS DR1 RGs, both with spectroscopic redshifts up to $z_\mathrm{max} = 0.16$, in the BORG SDSS Cosmic Web reconstructions. We measured the Cosmic Web density for each RG; for the control sample, we then quantified the relation between RG radio luminosity and Cosmic Web density. With the BORG SDSS tidal tensor, we also measured for each RG whether the gravitational dynamics of its Cosmic Web environment resemble those of clusters, filaments, sheets, or voids. Luminous giants populate large-scale environments that tend to be denser than those of general RGs. This shows that -- at least at high jet powers -- low-density environments are no prerequisite for giant growth. This result is corroborated by gravitational dynamics classification and a cluster catalogue crossmatching analysis. This work presents more than a thousand inferred megaparsec-scale densities around radio galaxies. Our findings are consistent with the view that giants are regular, rather than mechanistically special, members of the radio galaxy population.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

The goal of this extensive MWL campaign was to better understand the physics of the accreting black hole M87*, the relationship between the inflow and inner jets, and the high-energy particle acceleration. Understanding the complex astrophysics is also a necessary first step towards performing further tests of general relativity. The MWL campaign took place in April 2018, overlapping with the EHT M87* observations. We present a new, contemporaneous spectral energy distribution (SED) ranging from radio to very high energy (VHE) gamma-rays, as well as details of the individual observations and light curves. We also conduct phenomenological modelling to investigate the basic source properties. We present the first VHE gamma-ray flare from M87 detected since 2010.

We find that the X-ray flux is enhanced by about a factor of two compared to 2017, while the radio and millimetre core fluxes are consistent between 2017 and 2018. We detect evidence for a monotonically increasing jet position angle that corresponds to variations in the bright spot of the EHT image.

Forming off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies through Jacobi capture,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17423v2,"Thibaut L. François, Christian M. Boily, Jonathan Freundlich, Simon Rozier, Karina Voggel","It is well established that black holes reside in the central regions of virtually all types of known galaxies. Recent observational and numerical studies however challenge this picture, suggesting that intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies may be found on orbits far from the center. In particular, constant-density cores minimize orbital energy losses due to dynamical friction, and allow black holes to settle on stable off-center orbits. Using controlled simulations, we study the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies with such cores. We propose a new scenario to describe off-center mergers of massive black holes, starting with a Jacobi capture. We focus on initially circular and co-planar black hole orbits and explore a large parameter space of black hole masses and orbital parameters. We find that Jacobi captures are a complex and chaotic phenomenon that occurs in about 13% of cases in this simplified setup, and we quantify how the likelihood of capture depends on the simulation parameters. We note that this percentage is likely an upper limit of the general case. Nevertheless, we show that Jacobi captures in cored dwarf galaxies can facilitate the formation of off-center black hole binaries, and that this process is sufficiently common to have a substantial effect on black hole growth. While our setup only allows for temporary captures, we expect dissipative forces from baryons and post-Newtonian corrections to maintain the captures over time and to lead to the formation of stable binary systems. This motivates future studies of the effectiveness of such dissipative forces, within stripped nuclei or globular clusters, in forming stable bound systems.",{'black holes': 5},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Lens Stochastic Diffraction: A Signature of Compact Structures in Gravitational-Wave Data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17405v1,Miguel Zumalacárregui,"Every signal propagating through the universe is diffracted by the gravitational fields of intervening objects, aka gravitational lenses. Diffraction is most efficient when caused by compact lenses, which invariably produce additional images of a source. The signals associated with additional images are generically faint, but their collective effect may be detectable with coherent sources, such as gravitational waves (GWs), where both amplitude and phase are measured. Here, I describe lens stochastic diffraction (LSD): Poisson-distributed fluctuations after GW events caused by compact lenses. The amplitude and temporal distribution of these signals encode crucial information about the mass and abundance of compact lenses. Through the collective stochastic signal, LSD offers an order-of-magnitude improvement over single lens analysis for objects with mass $\gtrsim 10^3 M_\odot$. This gain can improve limits on compact dark-matter halos and allows next-generation instruments to detect supermassive black holes, given the abundance inferred from quasar luminosity studies.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Black Hole Singularity from OPE,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17286v1,"Nejc Čeplak, Hong Liu, Andrei Parnachev, Samuel Valach","Eternal asymptotically AdS black holes are dual to thermofield double states in the boundary CFT. It has long been known that black hole singularities have certain signatures in boundary thermal two-point functions related to null geodesics bouncing off the singularities (bouncing geodesics). In this paper we shed light on the manifestations of black hole singularities in the dual CFT. We decompose the boundary CFT correlator of scalar operators using the Operator Product Expansion (OPE) and focus on the contributions from the identity, the stress tensor, and its products. We show that this part of the correlator develops singularities precisely at the points that are connected by bulk bouncing geodesics. Black hole singularities are thus encoded in the analytic behavior of the boundary correlators determined by multiple stress tensor exchanges. Furthermore, we show that in the limit where the conformal dimension of the operators is large, the sum of multi-stress-tensor contributions develops a branch point singularity as predicted by the geodesic analysis. We also argue that the appearance of complexified geodesics, which play an important role in computing the full correlator, is related to the contributions of the double-trace operators in the boundary CFT.","{'black holes': 1, 'geodesics': 4}",04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

In this framework, we introduce the concept of atemporality as the dynamical mechanism responsible for the transition from a regime with a real-valued time variable to a new one featuring an imaginary time. We show that this mechanism prevents the occurrence of the singularity and, by means of the regularized Kretschmann invariant, we discuss in which terms atemporality can be considered as the characteristic feature of this black hole.",{'einstein equations': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we study the performance of a shrinking algorithm for COPs. The algorithm leverages correlations extracted from quantum or classical subroutines to recursively simplify the problem. We compare the performance of the algorithm equipped with correlations from the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) as well as the classical linear programming (LP) and semi-definite programming (SDP) relaxations. This allows us to benchmark the utility of QAOA correlations against established classical relaxation algorithms. We apply the recursive algorithm to MaxCut problem instances with up to a hundred vertices at different graph densities. Our results indicate that LP outperforms all other approaches for low-density instances, while SDP excels for high-density problems. Moreover, the shrinking algorithm proves to be a viable alternative to established methods of rounding LP and SDP relaxations. In addition, the recursive shrinking algorithm outperforms its bare counterparts for all three types of correlations, i.e., LP with spanning tree rounding, the Goemans-Williamson algorithm, and conventional QAOA. While the lowest depth QAOA consistently yields worse results than the SDP, our tensor network experiments show that the performance increases significantly for deeper QAOA circuits.",{'tensor network': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Tensor Networks']
Wormhole Formation with Gravitational Particle Creation Mechanism,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17208v2,"Mrinnoy M. Gohain, Chayanika Chetia, Kalyan Bhuyan","In this paper, we explore the possibility of the formation of a traversable wormhole geometry in General Relativity sustained by particle creation mechanism. Gravitational particle creation mechanism is a thermodynamic approach to generate repulsive back-reaction gravitational effects through the thermodynamic creation of particles. This repulsive back-reaction pressure can be thought of as a source of sustaining a traversable wormhole. In the first part of this paper, we systematically model a wormhole geometry through the process of particle creation by assuming an inverse square variation law of particle creation pressure within the wormhole geometry, and the shape function for the wormhole is obtained, assuming the redshift function as constant and finite. The obtained shape function is found to adhere to the feasibility conditions (flaring out condition and asymptotic flatness condition) of a viable wormhole geometry. In the second part of the paper, again by assuming a constant and finite redshift function, we studied the radial evolutionary behaviour of the particle creation pressures for three commonly utilized toy shape-functions. The examination of the energy conditions namely the Null Energy Condition (NEC) and the Dominant Energy Condition (DEC) for all these models reveal that the NEC is violated for the shape-function derived from the first principles of particle creation mechanism, as well as for the toy shape functions. The DEC is however found to be satisfied for all the aforementioned cases. In essence, NEC violation occurs through the particle creation phenomena inside the wormhole structure in spite of the existence of non-exotic matter.",{'traversable wormhole': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Robust hash functions transform inputs to outputs in such a way that the inputs cannot be later retrieved in a reasonable amount of time even if the outputs and the function that created them are known. Consequently, hash functions can be cryptographically secure, and they are employed in encryption, authentication, and other security methods. It has been suggested that such cryptographically-secure hash functions will play a critical role in the era of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), as they do in conventional systems. In this work, we introduce a procedure that leverages the principle of reversibility to generate circuits that invert hash functions.

Our study involves a reassessment of the constraints on PBHs through a comparative analysis of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and the emissions arising from their Hawking evaporation. We identify previously overlooked radiation processes across the relevant energy bands, potentially refining the bounds on PBHs. These processes encompass the direct emission from Hawking radiation, in-flight annihilation, the final state of radiation, and positronium annihilation. Thorough consideration is given to all these processes and their respective emission fractions, followed by a precise calculation of the $\mathcal{D}$ factor for observations directed towards the high-latitude Galactic contribution. Furthermore, we integrate the flux originating from extragalactic sources, both of which contribute to the measured isotropic flux. Through a comparative analysis of data derived from previous CXB observations utilizing an Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) double power-law model, we establish the most stringent constraints for PBHs, thereby excluding the possibility of PBHs constituting the entire dark matter mass within the range of $2.5\times 10^{17}-3 \times 10^{17} $g.","{'black holes': 1, 'hawking radiation': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We use these criteria to construct families of measurement-preparable states in one and two dimensions, tuning between distinct symmetry-breaking, symmetry-protected, and intrinsic topological phases of matter. For instance, in one dimension we chart out a three-parameter family of preparable states which interpolate between the AKLT, cluster, GHZ and other states of interest. Our protocol even allows one to engineer preparable quantum states with a range of desired correlation lengths and entanglement properties.

Magic zeroes in the black hole response problem and a Love symmetry resolution,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17030v1,Panagiotis Charalambous,"In this thesis, we present the emergence of an $SL(2,R)$ (""Love"") symmetry in the suitably defined near-zone region, relevant for studying the black hole response problem. This symmetry is globally defined and physical solutions of the black hole linearized field equations are closed under its action. The vanishing of static Love numbers is found to naturally arise as a selection rule following from the fact that the relevant solution belongs to a particular highest-weight representation of the Love symmetry. Interestingly, the Love symmetry appears to be connected to the well-known enhanced $SL(2,R)$ isometry subgroup of the near-horizon extremal geometry. Namely, the Love symmetry exactly reduces to the isometry of the near-horizon AdS$_2$ throat for extremal Reissner-Nordström black holes, while, for rotating black holes, one is lead to consider an infinite-dimensional $SL(2,R)\ltimes\hat{U}(1)_V$ extension of the Love symmetry, a family of subalgebras of which precisely recovers the Killing vectors of the corresponding AdS$_2$ throat in the extremal limit. Similar results persist when studying perturbations of general-relativistic black holes in higher dimensions. Even though the black hole static Love numbers now vanish only for a discrete set of resonant conditions that depends on the orbital number of the perturbation, Love symmetry exists independently of these details. This hints at a geometric interpretation of the Love symmetry; a statement that becomes more rigorous within the framework of subtracted geometries. However, Love symmetry appears to be theory-dependent. We extract, in particular, a sufficient geometric condition for its existence according to which, for instance, it does not exist in Riemann$^3$ gravity or some stringy-corrected low-energy effective gravitational actions, in accordance with explicit computations of the corresponding black hole Love numbers.",{'black holes': 3},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

These potentials emerge in theories with multiple couplings, where the ratio between them provide intrinsic length scales that break scale invariance. Our prescription, derived from the covariant phase space formalism, differs from previous approaches by enabling the construction of finite potentials without reference to any background. To do so, we consistently work with finite-size systems with Dirichlet boundary conditions and rigorously take into account boundary and corner terms: including these terms is found to be crucial for relaxing the integrability conditions for phase space quantities that were required in previous works.

At the same time, the increase in the signal-to-noise ratio of detected events allows for more precise estimates of the source parameters. This study aims to assess the performance of advanced-era networks of ground-based detectors, focusing on the Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and KAGRA instruments. We use full Bayesian parameter estimation procedures to predict the scientific potential of a network. Assuming a fixed LIGO configuration, we find that the addition of the Virgo detector is beneficial to the sky localization starting from a binary neutron star horizon distance of 20 Mpc and improves significantly from 40 Mpc onwards for both a single and double LIGO detector network, reducing the inferred mean sky-area by up to 95%. Similarly, the KAGRA detector tightens the constraints, starting from a sensitivity range of 10 Mpc. Looking at highly-spinning binary black holes, we find significant improvements with increasing sensitivity in constraining the intrinsic source parameters when adding Virgo to the two LIGO detectors. Finally, we also examine the impact of the low-frequency cut-off data on the signal-to-noise ratio. We find that existing 20 Hz thresholds are sufficient and propose a metric to monitor this to study detector performance.

While the upper bound overlaps with the familiar Hagedorn bound in the deformed theory, the novel lower bound on the negative values of the deformation parameter does not show up in thermodynamic quantities.

The Black-Hole Masses of High-Redshift QSOs,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16832v2,Andrew King,"Observations of high-redshift quasars frequently promote suggestions of large black hole masses, whose presence so early in cosmic time is not easily explicable. I consider the parallel with ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) -- now known to be stellar-mass black hole (and neutron star) binaries apparently radiating far above their Eddington luminosities $L_{\rm Edd}$. The true luminosity in ULXs is actually only of order $L_{\rm Edd}$, for {\it stellar-mass} accretors, but has a very anisotropic (`beamed') component, plus a near-isotropic component of similar luminosity but much lower specific intensity. Observers viewing ULXs from within the beam but assuming spherical symmetry deduce a luminosity $\gg L_{\rm Edd}$. These features appear because the accretors are fed mass at highly super-Eddington rates, most of it expelled in high-speed ($v >0.2c$) outflows from the accretion disc.
  I show that in similarly-beamed AGN, emission-line properties would be essentially the same as in unbeamed sources, but standard virial mass indicators unusable because velocity widths are dominated by the outflows, not bound motions about the black holes. In an ensemble of this kind the apparently most luminous systems are always the most distant, but have the lowest black hole masses. Interpreting observations of this ensemble without knowing that they are beamed leads instead to very high black hole mass estimates. The analogy with ULXs therefore suggests that high-redshift quasars might actually have central black hole masses which could have grown from stellar values within the lookback time.

Such quantum effect significantly enhances the lifetime, rendering the possibility of PBH mass $\lesssim 10^{9}$ g being the sole dark matter (DM) candidate. However, Nature can not rule out the existence of fundamental particles such as DM. We, therefore, include the possibility of populating the dark sector by the decay of PBHs to those fundamental particles, adding the contribution to stable PBH whose lifetime is extended due to the quantum corrections.

The finder is tested with both analytic data, such as Brill-Lindquist multiple black hole data, and numerical data, including off-centered Kerr-Schild data and dynamical inspiraling binary black hole data. The obtained results are compared with those generated by the current fastest finder AHFinderDirect (Thornburg, Class. Quantum Grav. 21, 743, 2003), which is the default finder in the open source code Einstein Toolkit. Our finder performs comparatively in terms of accuracy, and starts to outperform AHFinderDirect at high angular resolutions (\sim 1^\circ) in terms of speed. Our finder is also more flexible to initial guess, as opposed to the Newton's method used in AHFinderDirect. This suggests that the multigrid algorithm provides an alternative option for studying apparent horizons, especially when high resolutions are needed.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Constructing Optimal Noise Channels for Enhanced Robustness in Quantum Machine Learning,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16417v1,"David Winderl, Nicola Franco, Jeanette Miriam Lorenz","With the rapid advancement of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the critical need to enhance security measures against adversarial attacks and protect QML models becomes increasingly evident. In this work, we outline the connection between quantum noise channels and differential privacy (DP), by constructing a family of noise channels which are inherently $ε$-DP: $(α, γ)$-channels. Through this approach, we successfully replicate the $ε$-DP bounds observed for depolarizing and random rotation channels, thereby affirming the broad generality of our framework. Additionally, we use a semi-definite program to construct an optimally robust channel. In a small-scale experimental evaluation, we demonstrate the benefits of using our optimal noise channel over depolarizing noise, particularly in enhancing adversarial accuracy. Moreover, we assess how the variables $α$ and $γ$ affect the certifiable robustness and investigate how different encoding methods impact the classifier's robustness.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Deci-Hz gravitational waves from the self-interacting axion cloud around the rotating stellar mass black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16265v1,"Hidetoshi Omiya, Takuya Takahashi, Takahiro Tanaka, Hirotaka Yoshino","Gravitational waves from condensates of ultra-light particles, such as axion, around rotating black holes are a promising probe to search for unknown physics. For this purpose, we need to characterize the signal to detect the gravitational waves, which requires tracking the evolution of the condensates, including various effects. The axion self-interaction causes the non-linear coupling between the superradiant modes, resulting in complicated branching of evolution. Most studies so far have considered evolution under the non-relativistic approximation or the two-mode approximation. In this paper, we numerically investigate the evolution of the axion condensate without these approximations, taking higher multipole modes into account. We also investigate the possible signature in gravitational waves from the condensate. We show that the higher multipole modes are excited, leading to the gravitational wave signal by the transition of the axion between different levels. The most prominent signal of gravitational waves arises from the transition between modes with their angular quantum numbers different by two. The gravitational wave signal is emitted in the deci-Hz band for stellar mass black holes, which might be observable with the future gravitational wave detectors.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Guardians of the Quantum GAN,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16156v3,"Archisman Ghosh, Debarshi Kundu, Avimita Chatterjee, Swaroop Ghosh","Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) are at the forefront of image-generating quantum machine learning models. To accommodate the growing demand for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices to train and infer quantum machine learning models, the number of third-party vendors offering quantum hardware as a service is expected to rise. This expansion introduces the risk of untrusted vendors potentially stealing proprietary information from the quantum machine learning models. To address this concern we propose a novel watermarking technique that exploits the noise signature embedded during the training phase of qGANs as a non-invasive watermark. The watermark is identifiable in the images generated by the qGAN allowing us to trace the specific quantum hardware used during training hence providing strong proof of ownership. To further enhance the security robustness, we propose the training of qGANs on a sequence of multiple quantum hardware, embedding a complex watermark comprising the noise signatures of all the training hardware that is difficult for adversaries to replicate. We also develop a machine learning classifier to extract this watermark robustly, thereby identifying the training hardware (or the suite of hardware) from the images generated by the qGAN validating the authenticity of the model. We note that the watermark signature is robust against inferencing on hardware different than the hardware that was used for training. We obtain watermark extraction accuracy of 100% and ~90% for training the qGAN on individual and multiple quantum hardware setups (and inferencing on different hardware), respectively. Since parameter evolution during training is strongly modulated by quantum noise, the proposed watermark can be extended to other quantum machine learning models as well.",{'quantum machine learning': 4},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
A Comparative Analysis of Adversarial Robustness for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning Models,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16154v1,"Maximilian Wendlinger, Kilian Tscharke, Pascal Debus","Quantum machine learning (QML) continues to be an area of tremendous interest from research and industry. While QML models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks much in the same manner as classical machine learning models, it is still largely unknown how to compare adversarial attacks on quantum versus classical models. In this paper, we show how to systematically investigate the similarities and differences in adversarial robustness of classical and quantum models using transfer attacks, perturbation patterns and Lipschitz bounds. More specifically, we focus on classification tasks on a handcrafted dataset that allows quantitative analysis for feature attribution. This enables us to get insight, both theoretically and experimentally, on the robustness of classification networks. We start by comparing typical QML model architectures such as amplitude and re-upload encoding circuits with variational parameters to a classical ConvNet architecture. Next, we introduce a classical approximation of QML circuits (originally obtained with Random Fourier Features sampling but adapted in this work to fit a trainable encoding) and evaluate this model, denoted Fourier network, in comparison to other architectures. Our findings show that this Fourier network can be seen as a ""middle ground"" on the quantum-classical boundary. While adversarial attacks successfully transfer across this boundary in both directions, we also show that regularization helps quantum networks to be more robust, which has direct impact on Lipschitz bounds and transfer attacks.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Efficiently constructing a quantum uniform superposition over bit strings near a binary linear code,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16129v1,"Edward Farhi, Stephen P.

We do numerical experiments at $n=1000$ which back up our claims. The achievable radius $b$ is much larger than the distance out to which known classical algorithms can efficiently find the nearest codeword. Hence, these states cannot be prepared by quantum constuctions that require uncomputing to find the codeword nearest a string. Unlike the analogous states for lattices in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $|Ψ_b \rangle$ is not a useful resource for bounded distance decoding because the relevant overlap falls off too quickly with distance and known classical algorithms do better. Furthermore the overlap calculation can be dequantized. Perhaps these states could be used to solve other code problems. The technique used to construct these states is of interest and hopefully will have applications beyond codes.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We show that certain two-state overlap inequalities, recently introduced as witnesses of basis-independent coherence, are also witnesses of multi-qubit set magic.

Self-Gravitating Matter in Stationary and Axisymmetric Black Hole Spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16093v1,"Prashant Kocherlakota, Ramesh Narayan","All black holes (BHs) in nature are expected to be described by the Kerr vacuum solution of general relativity. However, the Kerr solution comes with several difficulties such as the existence of Cauchy horizons, curvature singularities, and causality-violating regions. Attempts to resolve some of these issues include phenomenological BH models, which typically contain nontrivial matter content. We introduce a simple framework here to examine the properties of matter in such phenomenological models for a broad class of stationary and axisymmetric spinning BH spacetimes, generated from nonspinning seed solutions via a metric ansatz. We apply this framework to a representative set of spinning BH spacetimes and the non-spinning seeds from which they are derived. The models span different types of matter - fluids, scalar fields, electromagnetic fields. For each model, we calculate the timelike four-velocity of the matter and thereby identify the rest frame of the matter, both outside and inside the horizon. We then examine the spatial distribution of the matter rest-frame energy density $ε$ and the principal pressures. This provides a complete picture of how the matter moves, what its material properties are, and whether it obeys the classical energy conditions. Notably, at a horizon, the normal component of the pressure always satisfies $p_n = -ε$. We also investigate the expansions of the principal null congruences and explore the Hawking mass profiles of these spacetimes. These provide glimpses into the geometry of the stationary BH exterior as well as the nonstationary interior cosmology. The axisymmetric metric ansatz we work with can be used to generate new spinning solutions from a variety of nonspinning seeds. The matter in these models often satisfies the weak energy condition, at least in the BH exterior, and some models exhibit non-rigid, differential rotation.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Constant-depth preparation of matrix product states with adaptive quantum circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16083v1,"Kevin C. Smith, Abid Khan, Bryan K. Clark, S. M. Girvin, Tzu-Chieh Wei","Adaptive quantum circuits, which combine local unitary gates, midcircuit measurements, and feedforward operations, have recently emerged as a promising avenue for efficient state preparation, particularly on near-term quantum devices limited to shallow-depth circuits. Matrix product states (MPS) comprise a significant class of many-body entangled states, efficiently describing the ground states of one-dimensional gapped local Hamiltonians and finding applications in a number of recent quantum algorithms. Recently, it was shown that the AKLT state -- a paradigmatic example of an MPS -- can be exactly prepared with an adaptive quantum circuit of constant-depth, an impossible feat with local unitary gates due to its nonzero correlation length [Smith et al., PRX Quantum 4, 020315 (2023)]. In this work, we broaden the scope of this approach and demonstrate that a diverse class of MPS can be exactly prepared using constant-depth adaptive quantum circuits, outperforming optimal preparation protocols that rely on unitary circuits alone. We show that this class includes short- and long-ranged entangled MPS, symmetry-protected topological (SPT) and symmetry-broken states, MPS with finite Abelian, non-Abelian, and continuous symmetries, resource states for MBQC, and families of states with tunable correlation length. Moreover, we illustrate the utility of our framework for designing constant-depth sampling protocols, such as for random MPS or for generating MPS in a particular SPT phase. We present sufficient conditions for particular MPS to be preparable in constant time, with global on-site symmetry playing a pivotal role. Altogether, this work demonstrates the immense promise of adaptive quantum circuits for efficiently preparing many-body entangled states and provides explicit algorithms that outperform known protocols to prepare an essential class of states.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Extension of Hayward black hole in $f(R)$ gravity coupled with a scalar field,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16081v1,G. G. L. Nashed,"This study looks into regular solutions in a theory of gravity called $f(R)$ gravity, which also involves a scalar field. The $f(R)$ theory changes Einstein's ideas by adding a new function related to something called the Ricci scalar. This lets us tweak the equations that describe how gravity works. Adding a scalar field makes the theory more interesting, giving us more ways to investigate and understand it. { The main goal of this research is to create regular black holes using a combination of $f(R)$ gravitational theory and a scalar field.} Regular solutions don't have any singularities, which are points where certain physical quantities, like invariants, become really big or undefined. { In this context, we find two regular black hole solutions by using a spherical space with either an equal or unequal approach.} For the solutions where we use the equal approach, we figure out the shape of $f(R)$ and how it changes, along with its first and second derivatives. We demonstrate that Hayward's solution in this theory stays steady because all the shapes of $f(R)$ and their first and second derivatives are positive. Next, we focus on the case where the metric isn't equal and figure out the black hole solution. We also find out what $f(R)$ and the scalar field look like in this situation. We demonstrate that the solution in this case is a broader version of the Hayward solution. When certain conditions are met, we end up back at the scenario where the metrics are equal. We also prove that this model is stable because $f(R)$, along with its first and second derivatives, are all positive. { We analyze the trajectories of these black hole solutions and determine the forms of their conserved quantities that remain same along those trajectories.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Benchmarking a heuristic Floquet adiabatic algorithm for the Max-Cut problem,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16001v1,"Etienne Granet, Henrik Dreyer","According to the adiabatic theorem of quantum mechanics, a system initially in the ground state of a Hamiltonian remains in the ground state if one slowly changes the Hamiltonian. This can be used in principle to solve hard problems on quantum computers. Generically, however, implementation of this Hamiltonian dynamics on digital quantum computers requires scaling Trotter step size with system size and simulation time, which incurs a large gate count. In this work, we argue that for classical optimization problems, the adiabatic evolution can be performed with a fixed, finite Trotter step. This ""Floquet adiabatic evolution"" reduces by several orders of magnitude the gate count compared to the usual, continuous-time adiabatic evolution. We give numerical evidence using matrix-product-state simulations that it can optimally solve the Max-Cut problem on $3$-regular graphs in a large number of instances, with surprisingly low runtime, even with bond dimensions as low as $D=2$.

Reissner-Nordström black holes surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter: testing the viability of weak gravity conjecture and weak cosmic censorship conjecture simultaneously,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15998v1,"Jafar Sadeghi, Saeed Noori Gashti","A possible violation of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) by cosmic censorship is one of the major challenges in the field of general relativity. However, in this paper, we explore the possibility of reconciling the WGC and the WCCC by considering Reissner-Nordström (R-N) black holes embedded in perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) in asymptotically flat spacetimes. These two conjectures are seemingly unrelated, but a recent proposal suggested that they are connected surprisingly. In particular, We argue a promising class of valid counterexamples to the WCCC in the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory, considering a charged black hole when WGC is present. We demonstrate that by imposing certain constraints on the parameters of the metric, the WGC and the WCCC can be compatible. Furthermore, we investigate the properties of the charged black hole in the presence of PFDM for $Q > M$ and present some intriguing figures to test the validity of the WGC and the WCCC simultaneously. When PFDM is absent ($γ=0$), the RN black hole either has two event horizons if $Q^2/M^2\leq 1$ or none if $Q^2/M^2> 1$. The second scenario results in a naked singularity, which contradicts the WCCC. But when PFDM is present ($γ\neq 0$), the RN black hole has event horizons with regard to Q and M. This implies that the singularity is always covered, and the WGC and the WCCC are fulfilled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that there is a critical value of $γ$, called $γ_{ext}$, that makes the RN black hole extremal when $γ=γ_{ext}$. In this situation, the black hole has an event horizon, and the WGC and the WCCC are still fulfilled. We infer that PFDM can make the WGC and the WCCC compatible with the RN black hole and that the WGC and the WCCC agree with each other when PFDM is present.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Weak Cosmic Censorship and Weak Gravity Conjectures in CFT Thermodynamics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15981v1,"Jafar Sadeghi, Saeed Noori Gashti, Mohammad Reza Alipour, Mohammad Ali S. Afshar","In this paper, we explore the intriguing interplay between fundamental theoretical physics concepts within the context of charged black holes. Specifically, we focus on the consistency of the weak gravity conjecture (WGC) and weak cosmic censorship conjecture (WCCC) in the thermodynamics of conformal field theory (CFT), and restricted phase space (RPS) for AdS Reissner-Nordstr$ö$m black holes with a perfect fluid dark matter (RN-PFDM). The WGC ensures that gravity remains the weakest force in the system. Meanwhile, the WCCC addresses the cosmic censorship problem by preventing the violation of fundamental physical laws near the black hole singularity. First, we analyze the RN black hole's free energy in both spaces, revealing a distinctive swallowtail pattern indicative of a first-order phase transition when certain free parameter conditions are met. We explore the WGC across different phase spaces, emphasizing the need for certain conditions in EPST, RPST, and CFT. We demonstrate that PFDM $( γ)$ and the radius of AdS ($l$) have a vital role in proving the satisfaction of the WGC. Also, these values have a linear relation with the range compatibility of WGC. The range of compatibility for WGC in RPST and EPST is the same while for CFT, this range is larger than EPST, and RPST. It means somehow the WGC and CFT are more consistent. The WCCC was examined at the critical juncture, confirming its validity with $( f(M_c, Q_c, r_c) = 0 )$. We conclude that the WGC is supported at the critical point of black holes, and the WCCC is also maintained, demonstrating the robustness of these conjectures within the critical ranges of black hole parameters.",{'black holes': 3},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Quantum teleportation plays a major role in communicating quantum information. As such, it is desirable to perform as few teleportations as possible when distributing a quantum algorithm on a network of quantum machines. Contrary to most existing methods which rely on graph-theoretic or heuristic search techniques, we propose a drastically different approach for minimizing the number of teleportations through utilizing formal methods. Specifically, the contributions of this paper include: the formal specification of the teleportation minimization problem in Alloy, the generalizability of the proposed Alloy specifications to quantum circuits with $n$-ary gates, the reusability of the Alloy specifications for different quantum circuits and networks, the simplicity of specifying and solving other problems such as load balancing and heterogeneity, and the compositionality of the proposed approach.

Observational signature of Lorentz violation in Kalb-Ramond field model and Bumblebee model: A comprehensive comparative study,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15808v1,Sohan Kumar Jha,"This article is devoted to the comparative study of the effects of the Lorentz symmetry violation (LV) arising in Kalb-Ramond (KR) and Bumblebee (BM) field models. We study optical appearance with accretion, Quasinormal modes, ringdown waveforms, Hawking radiation, and weak gravitational lensing. The horizon radius, photon radius, and the critical impact parameter for KR BHs decrease with the LV parameter $\a$. In contrast, they remain independent of the BM parameter $\b$ and have values the same as those for \s BH. We find that a KR BH is brighter than a \s or BM BH for static and infalling accretion. The BM BH, on the other hand, is brighter than a \s BH when the accretion is static but becomes darker for an infalling accretion. Our investigation into quasinormal modes (QNMs) and ringdown waveforms provides deeper insight into the difference in observational imprints of LV parameters. It reveals that GWs emitted by KR BHs have larger frequencies and decay faster than those emitted by \s or BM BHs for scalar and electromagnetic perturbations. We then study the greybody factor (GF) and power emitted for both BHs. The Hawking temperature is higher for a KR BM and lower for a BM BH than a \s BH. It also reveals that the transmission probability decreases with $\a$ and $\b$. A comparison of GFs for KR and BM BHs reveals that the transmission probability is higher for BM BH. We also study the effect of LV on the power emitted in the form of Hawking radiation. Power received by an asymptotic observer is larger for a KR BH. We obtain higher-order corrections in the deflection angle and graphically illustrate the impact of $\a$ and $\b$. We observe that a light ray gets deflected most from its path when passing by a \s BH, and the deflection is least when it passes by a KR BH.

Scherer, Wolfgang Mauerer","The study of variational quantum algorithms (VQCs) has received significant attention from the quantum computing community in recent years. These hybrid algorithms, utilizing both classical and quantum components, are well-suited for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Though estimating exact gradients using the parameter-shift rule to optimize the VQCs is realizable in NISQ devices, they do not scale well for larger problem sizes. The computational complexity, in terms of the number of circuit evaluations required for gradient estimation by the parameter-shift rule, scales linearly with the number of parameters in VQCs. On the other hand, techniques that approximate the gradients of the VQCs, such as the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), do not scale with the number of parameters but struggle with instability and often attain suboptimal solutions. In this work, we introduce a novel gradient estimation approach called Guided-SPSA, which meaningfully combines the parameter-shift rule and SPSA-based gradient approximation. The Guided-SPSA results in a 15% to 25% reduction in the number of circuit evaluations required during training for a similar or better optimality of the solution found compared to the parameter-shift rule.

By using the scheme, we can not only compute the energy spectrum for the lattice theory but also determine quantum numbers of the energy eigenstates. Furthermore, wave function of the corresponding eigenstate can also be computed. The first step of the scheme is to coarse-grain the tensor network of a given lattice model by using the higher order tensor renormalization group, and then after making a matrix corresponding to a transfer matrix from the coarse-grained tensors, its eigenvalues are evaluated to extract the energy spectrum. Secondly, the quantum number of the eigenstates can be identified by a selection rule that requires to compute matrix elements of an associated insertion operator. The matrix elements can be represented by an impurity tensor network and computed by the coarse-graining scheme. Moreover, we can compute the wave function of the energy eigenstate by putting the impurity tensor at each point in space direction of the network.

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that a spherically symmetric collapse is well-posed for a wide range of parameters. In the present paper we examine further the well-posedness through $3+1$ evolution of static and rotating black holes. We show that the evolution is indeed hyperbolic if the weak coupling condition is not severely violated. The loss of hyperbolicity is caused by the gravitational sector of the physical modes, thus it is not an artifact of the gauge choice. We further seek to compare the Ricci-coupled sGB theory against the standard sGB gravity with additional terms in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling. We find strong similarities in terms of well-posedness, but we also point out important differences in the stationary solutions. As a byproduct, we show strong indications that stationary near-extremal scalarized black holes exist within the Ricci-coupled sGB theory, where the scalar field is sourced by the spacetime curvature rather than the black hole spin.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

"Towards efficient Effective One Body models for generic, non-planar orbits",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15408v1,"Rossella Gamba, Danilo Chiaramello, Sayan Neogi","Complete waveform models able to account for arbitrary non-planar orbits represent a holy grail in current gravitational-wave astronomy. Here, we take a step towards this direction and present a simple yet efficient prescription to obtain the evolution of the spin vectors and of the orbital angular momentum along non-circularized orbits, that can be applied to any eccentric aligned-spins waveform model. The scheme employed is motivated by insights gained from the post-Newtonian (PN) regime. We investigate the phenomenology of the Euler angles characterizing the time-dependent rotation that connects the co-precessing frame to the inertial one, gauging the importance of non-circular terms in the evolution of the spins of a precessing binary. We demonstrate that such terms are largely negligible, irrespectively of the details of the orbit. Such insights are confirmed by studying the radiation-frame of a few eccentric, precessing numerical relativity (NR) simulations. Our investigations confirm that the usual ""twisting"" technique employed for quasi-spherical systems can be safely applied to non-circularized binaries. By then augmenting a state-of-the-art Effective-One-Body (EOB) model for non-circular planar orbits with the prescription discussed, we obtain an inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) model for eccentric, precessing binary black holes (BBHs).

Wandering intermediate-mass black holes in Milky Way-sized galaxies in cosmological simulations: myth or reality?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15404v1,"Floor van Donkelaar, Lucio Mayer, Pedro R.

We compare wandering-IMBH counts in different simulations with different sub-grid methods and post-processing recipes, the ultimate goal being to aid future wandering-IMBH detection efforts. In particular, we examine simulations in which IMBHs are identified as BH seeds forming at high redshift and those in which they are identified using star clusters as proxies, which implicitly appeals to a stellar dynamical formation channel. In addition, we employ the extremely high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamical ``zoom-in'' simulation GigaEris with the star cluster proxies method to identify IMBHs. We find consistent counts of wandering high-redshift IMBHs across most of the different cosmological simulations employed so far in the literature, despite the different identification approaches, resulting in 5 to 18 wandering IMBHs per Milky Way-sized galaxy at $z \geq 3$. Nevertheless, we argue this is only coincidental, as a significant discrepancy arises when examining the formation sites and the mass ranges of the wandering IMBHs. Furthermore, we cannot determine how many of the IMBHs identified at high redshift in GigaEris will be wandering IMBHs at $z = 0$ as opposed to how many will accrete to the central supermassive BH, promoting its growth. All of this casts doubts on the ability of current cosmological simulations to inform observational searches for wandering IMBHs.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Proof of a Universal Speed Limit on Fast Scrambling in Quantum Systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15403v1,"Amit Vikram, Laura Shou, Victor Galitski","We prove that the time required for sustained information scrambling in any Hamiltonian quantum system is universally at least logarithmic in the entanglement entropy of scrambled states. This addresses two foundational problems in nonequilibrium quantum dynamics. (1) It sets the earliest possible time for the applicability of equilibrium statistical mechanics in a quantum system coupled to a bath at a finite temperature. (2) It proves a version of the fast scrambling conjecture, originally motivated in models associated with black holes, as a fundamental property of quantum mechanics itself. Our result builds on a refinement of the energy-time uncertainty principle in terms of the infinite temperature spectral form factor in quantum chaos. We generalize this formulation to arbitrary initial states of the bath, including finite temperature states, by mapping Hamiltonian dynamics with any initial state to nonunitary dynamics at infinite temperature. A regularized spectral form factor emerges naturally from this procedure, whose decay is universally constrained by analyticity in complex time. This establishes an exact speed limit on information scrambling by the most general quantum mechanical Hamiltonian, without any restrictions on locality or the nature of interactions.","{'black holes': 1, 'quantum chaos': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Runtime-coherence trade-offs for hybrid SAT-solvers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15235v1,"Vahideh Eshaghian, Sören Wilkening, Johan Åberg, David Gross","Many search-based quantum algorithms that achieve a theoretical speedup are not practically relevant since they require extraordinarily long coherence times, or lack the parallelizability of their classical counterparts.This raises the question of how to divide computational tasks into a collection of parallelizable sub-problems, each of which can be solved by a quantum computer with limited coherence time. Here, we approach this question via hybrid algorithms for the k-SAT problem. Our analysis is based on Schöning's algorithm, which solves instances of k-SAT by performing random walks in the space of potential assignments. The search space of the walk allows for ""natural"" partitions, where we subject only one part of the partition to a Grover search, while the rest is sampled classically, thus resulting in a hybrid scheme. In this setting, we argue that there exists a simple trade-off relation between the total runtime and the coherence-time, which no such partition based hybrid-scheme can surpass. For several concrete choices of partitions, we explicitly determine the specific runtime coherence-time relations, and show saturation of the ideal trade-off. Finally, we present numerical simulations which suggest additional flexibility in implementing hybrid algorithms with optimal trade-off.",{'quantum computer': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Statistics of three-dimensional black holes from Liouville line defects,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15183v1,"Jeevan Chandra, Thomas Hartman, Viraj Meruliya","Black holes and wormholes in the gravitational path integral can be used to calculate the statistics of heavy operators. An explicit example in higher dimensions is provided by thin shells of matter. We study these solutions in 3D gravity, and reproduce the behavior of black holes and wormholes from the dual CFT using the large-$c$ conformal bootstrap. The CFT operator that creates a thin shell black hole is a line defect, so we begin by using the bootstrap to study the statistics of line defects, both at finite $c$ and in the holographic large-$c$ limit. The crossing equation leads to a universal formula for the average high-energy matrix elements of the line defect in any compact, unitary 2d CFT with $c>1$. The asymptotics are controlled by a line defect in Liouville CFT at the same value of the central charge. At large $c$, three distinct quantities are related: The statistics of line defects in holographic CFTs, the individual matrix elements of a line defect in Liouville CFT, and the on-shell action of black holes and wormholes in 3D gravity. The three calculations match for black holes, and if the statistics of the line defects are assumed to be approximately Gaussian, then a class of wormholes is also reproduced by the dual CFT.",{'black holes': 4},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We obtain the analytical expression for the Reinhart radius as a function of the polar angle $θ$ for a small $a/M$ limit for both the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black holes. We obtain the Reinhart radius using two independent methods: a) the vanishing trace of the extrinsic curvature and, b) the variational method. We further use the Reinhart radius to obtain an analytical expression for the interior volume of the Kerr and Kerr-Newman black hole in the small $a/M$ limit and a generic charge $Q$. We define $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ as the rate of change of the interior volume with respect to the ingoing null coordinate $v$ and then study its behavior under various scenarios, viz., particle accretion, the Penrose process, superradiance, and Hawking radiation. We show that while under the Penrose process and superradiance, the parameter $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ increases just like the area of a black hole but under particle accretion, $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ can have variable signs depending on the kinematical properties of the particle. We further probe into the behavior of $\mathcal{\dot{V}}$ under Hawking radiation.

We find that it includes a part originating from large impact parameter scattering that is non-analytic in the angle between detectors and is $\log N_c$ enhanced compared to the standard $1/N_c$ perturbative expansion. It is sensitive to the full bulk geometry, including the internal manifold, providing a refined probe of the emergent holographic spacetime.

Perelshtein","In optimization, one of the well-known classical algorithms is power iterations. Simply stated, the algorithm recovers the dominant eigenvector of some diagonalizable matrix. Since numerous optimization problems can be formulated as an eigenvalue/eigenvector search, this algorithm features wide applicability. Operationally, power iterations consist of performing repeated matrix-to-vector multiplications (or MatVec) followed by a renormilization step in order to converge to the dominant eigenvalue/eigenvector. However, classical realizations, including novel tensor network based approaches, necessitate an exponential scaling for the algorithm's run-time. In this paper, we propose a quantum realiziation to circumvent this pitfall. Our methodology involves casting low-rank representations; Matrix Product Operators (MPO) for matrices and Matrix Product States (MPS) for vectors, into quantum circuits. Specifically, we recover a unitary approximation by variationally minimizing the Frobenius distance between a target MPO and an MPO ansatz wherein the tensor cores are constrained to unitaries. Such an unitary MPO can easily be implemented as a quantum circuit with the addition of ancillary qubits. Thereafter, with appropriate initialization and post-selection on the ancillary space, we realize a single iteration of the classical algorithm. With our proposed methodology, power iterations can be realized entirely on a quantum computer via repeated, static circuit blocks; therefore, a run-time advantage can indeed be guaranteed.

Regular black holes as an alternative to black bounce,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14816v2,Kirill A.

Instead, it is proposed here to make $r=0$ a regular center by proper (Bardeen type) replacements in the metric, preserving its form at large $r$.

We find that for small values of $G$, increasing the nonlinearity of the Born-Infeld model makes the formation of the condensate harder -- consistent with previous results reported in the literature -- while for values of $G$ close to one, the opposite effect occurs; increasing the nonlinearity slightly facilitates its formation.

Ivanov","We present the first constraints on tidal heating for the binary systems detected in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave data. Tidal heating, also known as tidal dissipation, characterizes the viscous nature of an astrophysical body and provides a channel for exchanging energy and angular momentum with the tidal environment. Using the worldline effective field theory formalism, we introduce a physically motivated and easily interpretable parametrization of tidal heating valid for an arbitrary compact astrophysical object. We then derive the imprints of the spin-independent and linear-in-spin tidal heating effects of generic binary components on the waveform phases and amplitudes of quasi-circular orbits. Notably, the mass-weighted spin-independent tidal heating coefficient derived in this work, $\mathcal{H}_0$, is the dissipative analog of the tidal Love number. We constrain the tidal heating coefficients using the public LVK O1-O3 data. Our parameter estimation study includes two separate analyses: the first treats the catalog of binary events as binary black holes (BBH), while the second makes no assumption about the nature of the binary constituents and can therefore be interpreted as constraints for exotic compact objects. In the former case, we combine the posterior distributions of the individual BBH events and obtain a joint constraint of $-13 < \mathcal{H}_0 < 20$ at the $90\%$ credible interval for the BBH population.

Thermal chaos of charged-flat black hole via Rényi formalism,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14609v1,"F. Barzi, H. El Moumni, K. Masmar","Charged-flat black holes in the Rényi extended phase space demonstrate phase structures akin to those of a van der Waals fluid in four-dimensional spacetime and mirror the behaviors of Reissner-Nordstrom-Anti-de-Sitter black holes within the standard Gibbs-Boltzmann extended phase space. This study delves into the dynamics of states initially positioned within the unstable spinodal region of the phase space associated with the charged-flat black hole when subjected to time-periodic thermal perturbations. Our analysis based on the Mel'nikov method reveals that chaos emerges when the $δ$ parameter surpasses a critical threshold, $δ_c$. This critical quantity is dependent on the black hole charge; notably, a larger value of $Q$ impedes the onset of chaos.
  Furthermore, we examine the effects of space-periodic thermal perturbations on its equilibrium state and find that chaos invariably occurs, irrespective of the perturbation amplitude. Hence, the chaotic dynamics observed in the analysis of charged-flat black holes under Rényi statistics exhibit resemblances to those of asymptotically AdS-charged black holes investigated via the Gibbs-Boltzmann formalism. This serves as yet another example of a potential and significant connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensivity Rényi parameter.",{'black holes': 4},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH formation across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy--SMBHs evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Waves on Mazes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14477v1,"Iosif Bena, Raphaël Dulac, Anthony Houppe, Dimitrios Toulikas, Nicholas P.

Here we construct $\frac{1}{8}$-BPS solutions by adding momentum to a maze of M2-brane strips stretched between M5 branes. Before the addition of momentum, the $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS supergravity solution describing the maze is governed by a master function obeying a complicated Monge-Ampère equation. Given such a solution, we show that one can add momentum waves without modifying the $\frac{1}{4}$-BPS M2-M5 background. Remarkably, these excitations are fully determined by a layered set of $\textit{linear}$ equations. The fields responsible for carrying the momentum are parameterized by arbitrary functions of a null direction, and have exactly the same structure as in brane world-volume constructions. The fact that the momentum and flux excitations of the M2-M5-P system are governed by a linear structure brings us one step closer to using supergravity solutions to capture the entropy of supersymmetric black-holes.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

The resulting symmetries are strong enough to fix planar 2 and 3-point functions in the twisted theory or, equivalently, in a 1/4-BPS subsector of the original duality.

The measurement of orbital eccentricity can provide robust evidence for dynamical binary formation channels. We analyze 57 GW events from the first, second and third observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration using a multipolar aligned-spin inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform model with two eccentric parameters: eccentricity and relativistic anomaly. This is made computationally feasible with the machine-learning code DINGO which accelerates inference by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to traditional inference. First, we find eccentric aligned-spin versus quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factors of 1.84 to 4.75 (depending on the glitch mitigation) for GW200129, 3.0 for GW190701 and 1.77 for GW200208_22.

Third, our analysis does not show evidence for eccentricity in GW190521, which has an eccentric aligned-spin against quasi-circular aligned-spin $\log_{10}$ Bayes factor of 0.04.

With the increase of the magnetic field within the Y-shape superfluid phase, these modes diverge, with the roton excitation vanishing from the Goldstone mode branch, suggesting that the roton dip in this mode may just result from the energy-level repulsion imposed by the roton excitation in the gapped mode.

We deal with the slowly rotating black hole solutions up to order $\mathcal{O}(a^3)$, to first order in $α'$, including also the dilaton. We provide a detailed characterization of the geometry, as well as the ISCO and photon ring, and then we proceed to obtain the black hole images within the relativistic thin-disk model. We characterize the images by computing the diameter, displacement and asymmetry. A comparison with the Kerr case, indicates that all these quantities grow due to the $α'$ correction, and that the departure from GR for different observable is enhanced depending on the angle of view, namely for the diameter the maximum departure is obtained when the system is face-on, while for the displacement and asymmetry the departure from GR is maximized for edge-on point of view.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

The optimization process is conducted by minimizing the cross-entropy loss through parameterized quantum circuit optimization. The QCNN is tested on the MNIST dataset with 4, 6, 8 and 10 classes.

Demonstration of quantum projective simulation on a single-photon-based quantum computer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12729v1,"Giacomo Franceschetto, Arno Ricou","Variational quantum algorithms show potential in effectively operating on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

PS is a decision-making tool for reinforcement learning and can be classically represented as a random walk on a graph that describes the agent's memory. In its optical quantum version, this approach utilizes quantum walks of single photons on a mesh of tunable beamsplitters and phase shifters to select actions.

Erasure-tolerance scheme for the surface codes on Rydberg atomic quantum computers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12656v2,"Fumiyoshi Kobayashi, Shota Nagayama","Rydberg atom array with optical tweezers is a promising candidate for a fault-tolerant quantum computer, thanks to its good properties such as scalability, long coherence time and optical accessibility for communication. A big barrier to overcome is non-Pauli errors, erasure errors and leakage errors. Conventional work has revealed that leakage error is convertible to erasure error. A remaining problem is that such (converted) erasure errors continuously happen and accumulate. The previous proposal involved transporting atoms directly from the reservoir area, where atoms are stored for spare, to the computational area, where the computation and the error correction are processed, to correct atom loss. However, transporting atoms takes a long time and has side effects on surrounding qubits in practice. In this study, we evaluate the effects on planar code by circuit-based Monte Carlo simulation which has depolarizing errors and erasure errors, and propose a new scheme to tolerate that problem, namely, k-shift erasure recovery scheme. Our scheme uses online code deformation to tolerate erasures and repeatedly transfers the logical qubit from an imperfect array in which erasure errors accumulated to another perfect array in which erasure errors have been fixed by offline optical tweezers, to tolerate a large (accumulated) number of erasures. Furthermore, our scheme corrects erasure errors of atom arrays while logical qubits are evacuated from that area to correct; therefore, manipulating optical tweezers for erasure correction does not disturb qubits that compose logical data. We believe that our scheme provides practical directions for Rydberg atom quantum computers to realize feasible fault-tolerance.",{'quantum computer': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
First image of a jet launching from a black hole accretion system: Kinematics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12516v1,Brian Punsly,"Jets are endemic to both Galactic solar mass and extragalactic supermassive black holes. A recent 86 GHz image of M\,87 shows a jet emerging from the accretion ring around a black hole, providing the first direct observational constraint on the kinematics of the jet-launching region in any black hole jetted system. The very wide ($\sim280μ\rm{as}$), highly collimated, limb-brightened cylindrical jet base is not predicted in current numerical simulations. The emission was shown to be consistent with that of a thick-walled cylindrical source that apparently feeds the flow that produces the bright limbs of the outer jet at an axial distance downstream of $0.4 \,\rm{mas}<z<0.65\, \rm{mas}$. The analysis here applies the conservation laws of energy, angular momentum, and magnetic flux to the combined system of the outer jet, the cylindrical jet, and the launch region. It also uses the brightness asymmetries of the jet and counterjet to constrain the Doppler factor. The only global solutions have a source that is located $<34 μ\rm{as}$ from the event horizon. This includes the Event Horizon Telescope annulus of emission and the regions interior to this annulus. The axial jet begins as a magnetically dominated flow that spreads laterally from the launch radius ($<34 μ\rm{as}$). It becomes super-magnetosonic before it reaches the base of the cylindrical jet. The flow is ostensibly redirected and collimated by a cylindrical nozzle formed in a thick accretion disk. The flow emerges from the nozzle as a mildly relativistic ($0.3c<v<0.4c$) jet with a significant protonic kinetic energy flux.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We perform the first multi-scale and multi-phase characterisation of black-hole driven outflows in the $z\sim6.6$ quasar J0923+0402 and assess how these winds impact the cold gas reservoir. We employ the SimBAL spectral synthesis to fit broad absorption line (BAL) features and find a powerful ionized outflow on $\lesssim210$ pc scale, with a kinetic power $\sim2-100$\% of the quasar luminosity. ALMA observations of [CII] emission allow us to study the morphology and kinematics of the cold gas. We detect high-velocity [CII] emission, likely associated with a cold neutral outflow at $\sim0.5-2$ kpc scale in the host-galaxy, and a bright extended [CII] halo with a size of $\sim15$ kpc. For the first time at such an early epoch, we accurately constrain the outflow energetics in both the ionized and the atomic neutral gas phases. We find such energetics to be consistent with expectations for an efficient feedback mechanism, and both ejective and preventative feedback modes are likely at play. The scales and energetics of the ionized and atomic outflows suggest that they might be associated with different quasar accretion episodes. The results of this work indicate that strong black hole feedback is occurring in quasars at $z\gtrsim6$ and is likely responsible for shaping the properties of the cold gas reservoir up to circum-galactic scales.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Lighten up Primordial Black Holes in the Galaxy with the QCD axion: Signals at the LOFAR Telescope,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12437v1,"Ricardo Z. Ferreira, Ángel Gil Muyor","In this work, we study the luminosity that results from the conversion of QCD axion particles into photons in the magnetic field of the plasma accreting onto black holes (BHs). For the luminosities to be large two conditions need to be met: i) there are large numbers of axions in the PBH surroundings as a result of the so-called superradiant instability; ii) there exists a point inside the accreting region where the plasma and axion masses are similar and there is resonant axion-photon conversion. For BHs accreting from the interstellar medium in our galaxy, the above conditions require the black hole to have subsolar masses and we are therefore led to consider a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). In the conservative window, where we stay within the non-relativistic behavior of the plasma and neglect the possibility of non-linear enhancement via magnetic stimulation, the typical frequencies of the emitted photons lie on the low-radio band. We thus study the prospects for detection using the LOFAR telescope, assuming the PBH abundance to be close to the maximal allowed by observations. We find that for PBH and QCD axion with masses in the range $10^{-5}-10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ and $4 \times 10^{-8}$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ eV, respectively, the flux density emitted by the closest PBH, assuming it accretes from the warm ionized medium, can be detected at the LOFAR telescope. Coincidently, the PBH mass range coincides with the range that would explain the microlensing events found in OGLE. This might further motivate a dedicated search of these signals in the LOFAR data and other radio telescopes.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We do so by comparing the dynamics of a perturbed black hole evolved with the full (nonlinear) versus linearized Einstein equations. As expected, we find that the quasinormal mode amplitudes extracted from nonlinear evolution deviate from their linear counterparts at third order in initial perturbation amplitude. For perturbations leading to a change in the black hole mass and spin of $\sim 5\%$, which is reasonable for a remnant formed in an astrophysical merger, we find that nonlinear distortions to the complex amplitudes of some quasinormal modes can be as large as $\sim 50\%$ at the peak of the waveform. Furthermore, the change in the mass and spin results in a drift in the quasinormal mode frequencies, which for large amplitude perturbations causes the nonlinear waveform to rapidly dephase with respect to its linear counterpart. %These two nonlinear effects together create a large distortion in both the amplitude and phase of the ringdown gravitational waveform. Surprisingly, despite these nonlinear effects creating significant deviations in the nonlinear waveform, we show that a linear quasinormal mode model still performs quite well from close to the peak amplitude onwards.",{'einstein equations': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We aim to characterize this population by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model applied on top of the high resolution Millennium-II merger trees. Our results predict $\sim$10 wandering black holes with masses $\sim$2 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ in a typical $z$ = 0 Milky Way galaxy, accounting for $\sim$2$\%$ of the total non-stellar black hole mass budget of the galaxy. We find that the locations of these wanderers correlate with their formation scenario. While the ones concentrated at $\lesssim$1 kpc from the galactic nucleus on the disk come from past galactic mergers, the ones formed as a consequence of ejections due to gravitational recoils or the disruption of satellite galaxies are typically located at $\gtrsim$100 kpc. Such small and large distances might explain the absence of strong observational evidence for wandering black holes in the Milky Way. Our results also indicate that $\sim$67$\%$ of the wandering population is conformed by the leftovers of black hole seeds that had little to no growth since their formation. We find that wandering black holes that are leftover seeds become wanderers at an earlier time with respect to grown seeds, and also come from more metal-poor galaxies. Finally, we show that the number of wandering black holes in a Milky Way-type galaxy depends on the seeding efficiency.",{'black holes': 5},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

These serve as invaluable probes for unraveling the intricate structure and evolution of quasars, shedding light on the profound influence exerted by supermassive black holes on galaxy formation. The proliferation of large-scale spectroscopic surveys such as LAMOST, SDSS, and DESI has exponentially expanded the repository of quasar spectra at our disposal. In this study, we present an innovative approach to streamline the identification of BALQSOs, leveraging the power of dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithms. Our dataset is curated from the SDSS DR16, amalgamating quasar spectra with classification labels sourced from the DR16Q quasar catalog. We employ a diverse array of dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA), t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Isometric Mapping (ISOMAP), to distill the essence of the original spectral data. The resultant low-dimensional representations serve as inputs for a suite of machine learning classifiers, including XGBoost and Random Forest models. Through experimentation, we unveil PCA as the most effective dimensionality reduction methodology, adeptly navigating the intricate balance between dimensionality reduction and preservation of vital spectral information. Notably, the synergistic fusion of PCA with the XGBoost classifier emerges as the pinnacle of efficacy in the BALQSO classification endeavor, boasting impressive accuracy rates of 97.60% by 10-cross validation and 96.92% on the outer test sample.

In doing so, we construct new vacuum-rotating black holes in higher dimensions which can be viewed as the Levi-Civita extensions of the Myers-Perry geometries. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the double copy scheme within these new generated geometries still holds, providing an example of an algebraically general double copy framework. In the context of the Einstein-Scalar system, the paper extends the corresponding Buchdahl theorem to scenarios where a static vacuum seed configuration, transformed with respect to a spacelike Killing vector, generates a hairy black hole spacetime.

In this work, we study Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) in $f(R)$ gravity theory. We consider modification to gravity due to the existence of primordial black holes in the radiation era which introduce additional degrees of freedom known as scalarons. We calculate the light element abundances by using the BBN code PArthENoPE. It is found that for a range of scalaron mass $(2.2-3.5) \times 10^4$ eV, the abundance of lithium is lowered by $3-4$ times the value predicted by general relativistic BBN which is a level desired to address the cosmological lithium problem. For the above scalaron mass range helium abundance is within observed bound. However, deuterium abundance is found to be increased by $3-6$ times the observed primordial abundance which calls for high efficiency of stellar formation and evolution processes for destruction of the same. A novel relation between scalaron mass and black hole mass has been used to estimate that the above scalaron mass range corresponds to primordial black holes of sub-planetary mass ($\sim 10^{19}$ g) serving as one of the potential non-baryonic dark matter candidates.

Suppose that the spacetime is a 4-dimensional Riemannian manifold with a general stationary axisymmetric metric, we calculate Cartan's equation of structure and derive the Einstein tensor. In order to reduce the solving difficulty, we fix the gauge freedom to transform the metric into a more symmetric form. We solve the field equations in the two cases of the Ricci scalar $R=0$ and $R\neq 0$. In the case of $R=0$, the Ernst's equations are derived. We give the elementary solution of Ernst's equations and show the way to obtain more solutions including Kerr metric. In the case of $R\neq 0$, we reasonably assume that the solution to the equations consists of two parts: the first is Kerr part and the second is introduced by the Ricci scalar. Giving solution to the second part and combining the two parts, we obtain the Kerr-Ads metric. The calculations are carried out in a general $f(R)$ theory, indicating the Kerr and Kerr-Ads black holes exist widely in general $f(R)$ models.

VMSs could indeed collapse to form intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), which would then grow by accretion to become the supermassive black holes observed at the centers of galaxies and powering high-redshift quasars. Previous studies have investigated how different cluster initial conditions affect the formation of a VMS, including mass segregation, stellar collisions, and binaries, among others. In this study, we investigate the growth of VMSs with a new grid of Cluster Monte Carlo (CMC) star cluster simulations -- the most expansive to date. The simulations span a wide range of initial conditions, varying the number of stars, cluster density, stellar initial mass function (IMF), and primordial binary fraction. We find a gradual shift in the mass of the most massive collision product across the parameter space; in particular, denser clusters born with top-heavy IMFs provide strong collisional regimes that form VMSs with masses easily exceeding 1000 solar masses.

Geometric Quantum States Beyond AdS/CFT,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11644v1,"Raphael Bousso, Sami Kaya","We characterize the quantum states dual to entanglement wedges in arbitrary spacetimes, in settings where the matter entropy can be neglected compared to the geometric entropy. In AdS/CFT, such states obey special entropy inequalities known as the holographic entropy cone. In particular, the mutual information of CFT subregions is monogamous (MMI). We extend this result to arbitrary spacetimes, using a recent proposal for the generalized entanglement wedge e(a) of a gravitating region a. Given independent input regions a, b, and c, we prove MMI: Area[e(a)]+Area[e(b)]+Area[e(c)]-Area[e(ab)]-Area[e(bc)]-Area[e(ca)]+Area[e(abc)] $\leq$ 0.

In this Note, we apply this model to JADES GN 1146115, a dormant supermassive black hole at $z=6.7$ whose mass is $\sim40\%$ of the host's mass in stars and accreting at $\sim2\%$ of the Eddington limit. The host has been forming stars at the low rate of $\sim 1 \, \rm M_\odot \,yr^{-1}$ for the past $\sim 100$ Myr.

A central finding reveals that an excitation initially localized in the right SYK subsystem can be efficiently transmitted to the left subsystem subsequent to the characteristic scrambling time, a phenomenon facilitated by the intrinsic non-Hermitian nature of the system. The defining hallmark of non-Hermiticity is manifest in the asymmetric conveyance of quantum states, with the non-Hermitian parameter functioning as a tunable knob that selectively amplifies or dampens propagation modes on either side.

We investigated scalar field perturbations in Bardeen black hole spacetime in 5-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity. Using the 3rd-order WKB approximation and the finite-difference method, we computed the frequency of quasinormal modes (QNMs) in the spacetime background. The calculations demonstrated that the real part of the QNMs $ω$ increased, whereas the imaginary part decreased with increase in the magnetic charge parameter $Q$ of the Bardeen black hole for a fixed Gauss-Bonnet parameter $α$. This was also valid when $Q$ was fixed and $α$ increased; where in the real part of the QNMs increased and the absolute value of the imaginary part decreased. However, the change in the latter case was more significant than that in the former; thus, the frequency of eigenvibration of this black hole background under the scalar field perturbation increased and the decay of eigenvibration decreased with increase in $α$ or $Q^2$. Moreover, this result shows that the effect of $α$ on the intrinsic vibration of this black hole was greater than that of $Q $.Finally we found an interesting phenomenon by comparing black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. With higher dimensions, the real part of the QNMs changes more obviously, but the imaginary part of the QNMs is almost unchanged. This phenomenon also indicates that the frequency of gravitational waves released by higher dimensional black holes becomes larger, but the decay rate is almost constant.",{'black holes': 3},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Constraining the Modified Friction in Gravitational Wave Propagation with Precessing Black Hole Binaries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11245v2,"Chunbo Lin, Tao Zhu, Rui Niu, Wen Zhao","A broad class of modified gravities can result in a modified friction effect in the propagation of gravitational waves (GWs). This effect changes the amplitude-damping rate of GWs during their propagation in the cosmological distance and thus modifies the standard luminosity distance of GWs in general relativity. Therefore, one can constrain this modified friction by measuring both the luminosity distance and redshift of the GW sources. In this paper, we investigate the prospects of constraining such modified friction effect by using the precessing binary black holes with ground-based GW detectors. For this purpose, we consider 20 precessing events detected by the GW detector network consisting of two LIGO detectors and two third-generation GW detectors (the Einstein Telescope and the Cosmic Explorer). The redshift information of these events is obtained by identifying their possible host galaxies in the GLADE+ galaxy catalog. We show that the precession in the binary system can improve significantly the precision of luminosity distance and thus lead to a tighter constraint on the modified friction. By assuming narrow priors on cosmological parameters that are consistent with the uncertainties of Planck 2018 results, our analysis shows that the modified friction effect, characterized by two parameters $(Ξ_0, n)$, can be constrained to be $Ξ_0 = 1.002^{+0.004}_{-0.004}$ and $n=3.257^{+2.595}_{-2.192}$, in which the result of $Ξ_0$ is about two orders of magnitude better than current result from an analysis with GWTC-3. Our result sets the stage for future research with third-generation GW detectors, offering new insights into gravitational parameter modifications.

Despite their importance to enable strong-field tests of gravity, little to nothing is known about what overtones and quasinormal-mode amplitudes are like for black holes in extensions to general relativity. We take a first step in this direction and study what is arguably the simplest model that allows first-principle calculations to be made: a nonrotating black hole in an effective-field-theory extension of general relativity with cubic-in-curvature terms. Using a phase-amplitude scheme that uses analytical continuation and the Prüfer transformation, we compute, for the first time, the quasinormal overtone frequencies (in this theory) and quasinormal-mode excitation factors (in any theory beyond general relativity). We find that the overtone quasinormal frequencies and their excitation factors are more sensitive than the fundamental mode to the lengthscale $l$ introduced by the higher-derivative terms in the effective field theory. We argue that a description of all overtones cannot be made within the regime of validity of the effective field theory, and we conjecture that this is a general feature of any extension to general relativity that introduces a new lengthscale. We also find that a parametrization of the modifications to the general-relativistic quasinormal frequencies in terms of the ratio between $l$ and the black hole's mass is somewhat inadequate, and we propose a better alternative. As an application, we perform a preliminary study of the implications of the breakdown, in the effective field theory, of the equivalence between the quasinormal mode spectra associated to metric perturbations of polar and axial parity of the Schwarzschild black hole in general relativity. We also present a simple justification for the loss of isospectrality.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

In this study, we propose an alternative remote cross-resonance gate. Considering multiple modes of a superconducting coaxial cable connecting qubits, we must find conditions under which the cross-resonance gate operates with a certain accuracy even in the presence of qubit frequency shifts due to manufacturing errors. For 0.25- and 0.5-m cables, remote cross-resonance gates with a concurrence of $>99.9\%$ in entanglement generation are obtained even with $\pm$10-MHz frequency shifts. For a 1-m cable with a narrow mode spacing, a concurrence of 99.5\% is achieved by reducing the coupling between the qubits and cable. The optimized echoed raised-cosine pulse duration is 150--400 ns, which is similar to the operation time of cross-resonance gates between neighboring qubits on a chip. The dissipation through the cable modes does not considerably affect the obtained results.

However, JWST has also revealed that some of the classical diagnostics, such as the BPT diagrams and X-ray emission, often fail to identify narrow line TypeII active galactic nuclei (AGN) at high redshift. Here we present three new rest-frame optical diagnostic diagrams leveraging the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ auroral line, which has been detected in several JWST spectra. Specifically, we show that high values of the [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$γ$ ratio provide a sufficient (but not necessary) condition to identify the presence of an AGN, both based on empirical calibrations (using local and high-redshift sources) and a broad range of photoionization models. These diagnostics are able to separate much of the AGN population from Star Forming Galaxies (SFGs). This is because the average energy of AGN's ionizing photons is higher than that of young stars in SFGs, hence AGN can more efficiently heat the gas, therefore boosting the [OIII]$\lambda4363$ line. We also found independent indications of AGN activity in some high-redshift sources that were not previously identified as AGN with the traditional diagnostics diagrams, but that are placed in the AGN region of the diagnostics presented in this work. We note that, conversely, low values of [OIII]$\lambda4363/$H$γ$ can be associated either with SFGs or AGN excitation. We note that the fact that strong auroral lines are often associated with AGN does not imply that they cannot be used for direct metallicity measurements (provided that proper ionization corrections are applied), but it does affect the calibration of strong line metallicity diagnostics.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

One of the major obstacles in current CGH frameworks lies in the limited memory available on consumer-grade GPUs which could not facilitate the generation of higher-definition holograms. To overcome the aforementioned challenge, we proposed a divide-conquer-and-merge strategy to address the memory and computational capacity scarcity in ultra-high-definition CGH generation. This algorithm empowers existing CGH frameworks to synthesize higher-definition holograms at a faster speed while maintaining high-fidelity image display quality.

Rosa","We study the dynamical evolution of superradiant instabilities of rotating black holes for multiple axion fields with comparable masses, motivated by string theory constructions, which typically exhibit a large number of light axions, with a broad range of masses. We show, in particular, that even though superradiant clouds for the heavier axion species grow faster, they are eventually reabsorbed by the black hole as the latter amplifies the lighter axion field(s), analogously to the dynamics of different species competing for the same resources in an ecosystem. We also incorporate in our study the effects of accretion and gravitational wave emission. We further demonstrate that the existence of multiple axion species with comparable masses may have a substantial impact on the stochastic gravitational wave background produced by axion clouds around black hole binary merger remnants, which could be probed with planned detectors.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

J. de Bruijne","Gravitational waves from black-hole merging events have revealed a population of extra-galactic BHs residing in short-period binaries with masses that are higher than expected based on most stellar evolution models - and also higher than known stellar-origin black holes in our Galaxy. It has been proposed that those high-mass BHs are the remnants of massive metal-poor stars. Gaia astrometry is expected to uncover many Galactic wide-binary systems containing dormant BHs, which may not have been detected before. The study of this population will provide new information on the BH-mass distribution in binaries and shed light on their formation mechanisms and progenitors. As part of the validation efforts in preparation for the fourth Gaia data release (DR4), we analysed the preliminary astrometric binary solutions, obtained by the Gaia Non-Single Star pipeline, to verify their significance and to minimise false-detection rates in high-mass-function orbital solutions. The astrometric binary solution of one source, Gaia BH3, implies the presence of a 32.70 \pm 0.82 M\odot BH in a binary system with a period of 11.6 yr. Gaia radial velocities independently validate the astrometric orbit. Broad-band photometric and spectroscopic data show that the visible component is an old, very metal-poor giant of the Galactic halo, at a distance of 590 pc. The BH in the Gaia BH3 system is more massive than any other Galactic stellar-origin BH known thus far. The low metallicity of the star companion supports the scenario that metal-poor massive stars are progenitors of the high-mass BHs detected by gravitational-wave telescopes. The Galactic orbit of the system and its metallicity indicate that it might belong to the Sequoia halo substructure. Alternatively, and more plausibly, it could belong to the ED-2 stream, which likely originated from a globular cluster that had been disrupted by the Milky Way.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Linear instability of hairy black holes in Horndeski theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10456v1,"Chao Zhang, Tao Zhu","The Horndeski theory gives the most general model of scalar-tensor theories. It draws a lot of attentions in recent years on its black holes, celestial dynamics, stability analysis, etc. It is important to notice that, for certain subclasses of Horndeski models, one can obtain analytic solutions to the background fields. This provides us with a good opportunity to investigate the corresponding stability problems in details. Specially, we may find out the constraints to the model or theory, under which the stability conditions can be satisfied. In this paper, we focus on a subclass of the Horndeski theory and a set of analytic background solutions are considered. On top of that, the odd-parity gravitational perturbation and the 2nd-order Lagrangian are investigated. With careful analysis, the instability is identified within the neighborhood of event horizon. We are thus able to exclude a specific geometry for the model. It is interesting to notice that, such an instability is implanted in the structure of the corresponding Lagrangian, and will not by erased by simply adding numerical constraints on the coupling parameters.

Single photon detectors (SPDs) were demonstrated from $γ$-rays to infrared wavelengths, and extending this range down to the microwaves is the focus of intense research. The energy of $10\,\mathrm{GHz}$ microwave photon, about $40\,\mathrm{μeV}$ or $7\, \mathrm{yJ},$ is enough to force a superconducting Josephson junction into its resistive state, making it suitable to be used as a sensor. In this work, we use an underdamped Josephson junction to detect single thermal photons stochastically emitted by a microwave copper cavity at millikelvin temperatures. After characterizing the source and detector, we vary the temperature of the resonant cavity and measure the increased photon rate. The device shows an efficiency up to 40% and a dark count rate of $0.1\,\mathrm{Hz}$ in a bandwidth of several gigahertz.

These galaxies are classified as compact, normal, or extended by referencing their locations on the mass-size ($M_\star-R_{\rm 1/2}$) diagram. This research demonstrates the distinctive evolutionary pathways of galaxies with different sizes in IllustrisTNG simulations, primarily driven by nature. It is confirmed that disk galaxies inherit the angular momentum of their parent dark matter halos. More compact galaxies form earlier within halos possessing lower specific angular momentum through heightened star formation during the early phase at redshifts above 2. During the later phase, the size of extended galaxies experiences more pronounced growth by accreting gas with high angular momentum. Additionally, we reveal that many key characteristics of galaxies are linked to their mass and size: (1) compact galaxies tend to exhibit higher metal content, proportional to the potential well $\frac{M_\star}{R_{\rm 1/2}}$, (2) compact galaxies host more massive bulges and black holes, and higher central concentration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that galaxies of all types continue to actively engage in star formation, with no evident signs of quenching attributed to their varying sizes and angular momenta.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Holographic Renormalization Group and Stress Tensor Operators,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10190v1,Stephen Ebert,"The holographic duality conjectures a relation between strongly coupled quantum systems and quantum gravity in higher-dimensional spacetimes. Gravitational theories in two and three dimensions are meaningful examples for classical and quantum exploration due to their unique characteristics, notably the absence of propagating bulk degrees of freedom and the presence of only boundary degrees of freedom, distinguishing them from higher-dimensional counterparts. These gravitational theories exhibit complex interactions when the bulk spacetime has a finite size, regulated by Zamolodchikov's double-trace irrelevant $T\overline{T}$ operator.
  This thesis aims to gain a holographic understanding of $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ and JT gravity under the influence of the $T\overline{T}$ deformation. Under a finite radial cutoff, these theories exhibit perturbative behavior that implies the emergence of the Nambu-Goto action for the corresponding boundary graviton action. We also conducted semi-classical calculations of observables related to finite-cutoff gravity and its dual $T\overline{T}$-deformed CFT description, including correlation functions involving stress tensors and gravitational Wilson lines, along with an analysis of their supersymmetric extensions. Additionally, we explored the implications of general stress tensor deformations within field-theoretic and holographic settings.

We study a model that produces a critical point in the chiral phase diagram by introducing a coupling between the scalar chiral field and the dilaton. We examine the effect of the scalar-dilaton coupling on the critical point.

Quantum Risk Analysis of Financial Derivatives,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10088v1,"Nikitas Stamatopoulos, B. David Clader, Stefan Woerner, William J.

Previous work in the literature has shown that quantum advantage is possible in the context of individual derivative pricing and that advantage can be leveraged in a straightforward manner in the estimation of the VaR and CVaR. The algorithms we introduce in this work aim to provide an additional advantage by encoding the derivative price over multiple market scenarios in superposition and computing the desired values by applying appropriate transformations to the quantum system. We perform complexity and error analysis of both algorithms, and show that while the two algorithms have the same asymptotic scaling the QSP-based approach requires significantly fewer quantum resources for the same target accuracy. Additionally, by numerically simulating both quantum and classical VaR algorithms, we demonstrate that the quantum algorithm can extract additional advantage from a quantum computer compared to individual derivative pricing. Specifically, we show that under certain conditions VaR estimation can lower the latest published estimates of the logical clock rate required for quantum advantage in derivative pricing by up to $\sim 30$x. In light of these results, we are encouraged that our formulation of derivative pricing in the QSP framework may be further leveraged for quantum advantage in other relevant financial applications, and that quantum computers could be harnessed more efficiently by considering problems in the financial sector at a higher level.",{'quantum computer': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Here, we investigate the occurrence of the LZSM phenomenon in nonlinear multilevel bosonic systems, where the interference pattern is determined by multiple energy levels and cannot be described by a level crossing between only two states. We fabricate two superconducting resonators made of flux-tunable Josephson junction arrays. The first device is very weakly nonlinear (the nonlinearity is smaller than the photon-loss rate) and, when a weak driving field is applied, it behaves as a linear resonator, yet shows the same LZSM interference as in a two-level system. Notably, here the interference originates from multiple avoided level crossings of the harmonic ladder. When subjected to a stronger drive, nonlinear effects start playing a role, and the interference pattern departs from the one observed in two-level systems. We demonstrate that, when two or more LZSM interference peaks merge, dissipative quantum chaos emerges. In the second device, where the nonlinearity surpasses the photon-loss rate, we observe additional LZSM interference peaks due to Kerr multiphoton resonances. When described under the light of the Floquet theory, these resonances can be interpreted as synthetic modes of an array of coupled cavities. We derive a simple effective model highlighting the essential features of the entirety of these phenomena.

For probing a relatively large system size ($64\times 64$), we observe up to an order of magnitude reduction in the number of qubits, compared to the approaches based on quantum phase estimation (QPE). We discuss two complementary strategies to measure the energy. The first approach is based on a random sampling of the local terms of the Hamiltonian, requiring $\mathcal{O}(1/ε^2)$ invocations of quantum circuits, each of which have depth of at most $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$, where $ε$ is the relative precision in the energy and $N$ is the system size. The second approach is based on a coherent estimation of the expectation value of observables averaged over space, which achieves the Heisenberg scaling while incurring only a logarithmic cost in the system size. For estimating the energy per site of $ε$, $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log N}ε \right)$ $T$ gates and $\mathcal{O}\left(\log N \right)$ qubits suffice. The constant factor of the leading contribution is shown to be determined by the depth of the DMERA circuit, the gates used in the ansatz, and the periodicity of the circuit. We also derive tight bounds on the variance of the energy gradient, assuming the gates are random Pauli rotations.","{'entanglement renormalization': 1, 'quantum computer': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Our observations reveal a sudden decrease in the X-ray brightness by a factor of $\gtrsim 14$ over a factor of $\approx 2.3$ in time, and a deviation from the earlier power-law decline with a steepening $α\gtrsim 3.2$ ($F_X \propto t^{-α}$), steeper than expected for a jet break, and pointing to the cessation of jet activity at $t_{\rm obs} \approx 215$ days. Such a transition has been observed in two previous TDEs (Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05). From the X-ray luminosity and the timescale of jet shutoff, we parameterize the mass of the SMBH in terms of unknown jet efficiency and accreted mass fraction parameters. Motivated by the disk-jet connection in AGN, we favor black hole masses $\lesssim 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$ (where the jet and disk luminosities are comparable), and disfavor larger black holes (in which extremely powerful jets are required to outshine their accretion disks). We additionally estimate a total accreted mass of $\approx 0.1 \rm \ M_{\odot}$. Applying the same formalism to Swift J1644+57 and Swift J2058+05, we favor comparable black hole masses for these TDEs of $\lesssim$ a few $\times 10^5 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, and suggest that jetted TDEs may preferentially form from lower mass black holes when compared to non-relativistic events, owing to generally lower jet and higher disk efficiencies at higher black hole masses.",{'black holes': 3},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We investigate the two formation channels in GWTC-3, with a dedicated semi-parametric population model, i.e., a mixture of two sub-populations with different spin-orientation distributions (one is nearly-aligned and the other is nearly-isotropic).

While the existence of stellar-mass BHs has been confirmed through observation of X-ray binaries within our galaxy and gravitational waves from extragalactic BH binaries, a conclusive observation of microlensing events caused by Galactic BH binaries has yet to be achieved. In this study, we focus on those with high eccentricity, including unbound orbits, which can dynamically form in star clusters and could potentially increase the observation rate. We demonstrate parameter estimation for simulated light curves supposing various orbital configurations of BH binary lenses. We employ a model-based fitting using the Nelder-Mead method and Bayesian inference based on the Markov chain Monte Carlo method for the demonstration. The results show that we can retrieve true values of the parameters of high eccentric BH binary lenses within the 1$σ$ uncertainty of inferred values. We conclude it is feasible to find high eccentric Galactic BH binaries from the observation of binary microlensing events.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
"Information Gain, Operator Spreading, and Sensitivity to Perturbations as Quantifiers of Chaos in Quantum Systems",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09464v1,Abinash Sahu,"We adopt a continuous weak measurement tomography protocol to explore the signatures of chaos in the quantum system(s). We generate the measurement record as a series of expectation values of an observable evolving under the desired dynamics, which can show a transition from integrability to chaos. We find that the rate of information gain depends on the degree of chaos in the dynamics, the choice of initial observable, and how well the operator is aligned along the density matrix. The amount of operator spreading in the Krylov subspace, as quantified by the fidelity in quantum tomography and various other metrics of information gain, increases with the degree of chaos in the system. We study operator spreading in many-body quantum systems by its potential to generate an informationally complete measurement record. Our quantifiers for operator spreading are more consistent indicators of quantum chaos than Krylov complexity. Our study gives an operational interpretation for operator spreading in terms of fidelity gain in quantum tomography.
  Continuing in our journey of finding the footprints of chaos in the quantum domain, we explore the growth of errors in noisy tomography. For random states, when the measurement record is obtained from a random operator, the subsequent drop in the fidelity obtained is inversely correlated to the degree of chaos in the dynamics. This gives us an operational interpretation of Loschmidt echo for operators by connecting it to the performance of quantum tomography. We find a quantity to capture the scrambling of errors, an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) between two operators under perturbed and unperturbed dynamics that serves as a signature of chaos. Our results demonstrate a fundamental link between Loschmidt echo and scrambling of errors, as captured by OTOCs, with operational consequences in quantum information processing.",{'quantum chaos': 1},04.2024,2024,04,[]

It has recently been suggested that the partner mode of the analog Hawking radiation emitted from a moving mirror would manifest itself through a final burst when the mirror executes a sudden stop. Here we argue the opposite via the partner formula for the moving mirror model. By expanding the theoretical foundation of the partner formula and augmenting it with numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the supposed final burst is induced by a shock that requires the input of external energy, whereas the Hawking radiation partner mode, which is associated with the zero-point vacuum fluctuations, is not responsible for the burst.",{'hawking radiation': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Here we report a set of simulations that capture the relativistic disruption of the star, followed by one year of evolution of the returning debris stream. These reveal the formation of an expanding asymmetric bubble of material extending to hundreds of astronomical units -- an Eddington envelope with an optically thick inner region. Such envelopes have been hypothesised as the reprocessing layer needed to explain optical/UV emission in tidal disruption events, but never produced self-consistently in a simulation.

By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory with a difference: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy.

Through time-domain integration, we demonstrate that, contrary to the asymptotically flat case, the quasinormal modes also dictate the asymptotic decay of fields. Employing the 6th order WKB formula, we derive a precise analytic approximation for quasinormal modes in the regime $μM/m_{P}^2 \gg 1$ without resorting to expansion in terms of the inverse multipole number.

Based on thermodynamic stability that sufficiently large black holes should not fragment, we argue that Barrow entropy correction must be small except possibly at the Planckian regime. Furthermore, the fact that a solar mass black hole does not fragment implies an upper bound $δ\lesssim O(10^{-3})$, which surprisingly lies in the same range as the bound obtained from some cosmological considerations assuming fixed $δ$.

A search for intermediate-mass black holes in compact stellar systems through optical emissions from tidal disruption events,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09144v1,"Richard T. Pomeroy, Mark A.

Tidal disruption events (TDEs), where a star is tidally disrupted by the gravitational field of a black hole, have been observed to occur around the supermassive black holes (SMBH) found at the centres of galaxies, and should also arise around IMBHs, especially in the dense stellar cores of CSS's. However, to date none have been observed in such environments. Using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) we search for TDEs associated with CSS, but none are found. This non-detection allows us to set an upper limit on the TDE rate in CSS of $n_\text{TDE,Total}\lessapprox10^{-7} CSS^{-1}\text{yr}^{-1}$ which is two dex. below the observed TDE rate involving SMBH interacting with 1\Msun\ main sequence stars in the nuclei of massive galaxies. We also consider ultra compact dwarfs (UCDs) formed through a tidal stripping process in the surveyed volume. On the assumption these CSS contain SMBH and TDE rates are comparable to current observed optical rates in galactic nuclei ($\approx\num{3.2E-5}\text{gal}^{-1}\text{yr}^{-1}$), we determine an upper limit for the number of UCDs formed through a tidal stripping process in the surveyed volume to be $N_\text{GC, Strip}<\num{1.4E4}$, which we estimate represents $< 6\%$ of the population of GCs $>10^6\Msun$.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We consider a noise model where the initial qubits undergo depolarizing noise before the application of the CZ operations that generate edges between qubits situated at the nodes of the resulting graph state. For this model we develop a method for calculating the coherent information -- a lower bound on the rate at which entanglement can be distilled, across a bipartition of the graph state. We also identify some patterns on how adding more nodes or edges affects the bipartite distillable entanglement.

In this work, we demonstrate how quantum algorithms and hardware can be employed to model stochastic chemical kinetics as described by the CME using the Schlögl Model of a trimolecular reaction network as an illustrative example. To ground our study of the performance of our quantum algorithms, we first determine a range of suitable parameters for constructing the stochastic Schlögl operator in the mono- and bistable regimes of the model using a classical computer and then discuss the appropriateness of our parameter choices for modeling approximate kinetics on a quantum computer. We then apply the Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to evaluate the smallest-magnitude eigenvalues, $λ_0$ and $λ_1$, which describe the transition rates of both the mono- and bi-stable systems, and the Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) algorithm combined with the Variational Quantum Singular Value Decomposition (VQSVD) algorithm to estimate the zeromode (ground state) of the bistable case.

This technology has made remarkable progress with the demonstration of single and two-qubit gates above the fault-tolerant threshold and entanglement of up to three qubits. However, maintaining high fidelity operations while executing multi-qubit algorithms has remained elusive, only being achieved for two spin qubits to date due to the small qubit size, which makes it difficult to control qubits without creating crosstalk errors. Here, we use a four-qubit silicon processor with every operation above the fault tolerant limit and demonstrate Grover's algorithm with a ~95% probability of finding the marked state, one of the most successful implementations to date. Our four-qubit processor is made of three phosphorus atoms and one electron spin precision-patterned into 1.5 nm${}^2$ isotopically pure silicon. The strong resulting confinement potential, without additional confinement gates that can increase cross-talk, leverages the benefits of having both electron and phosphorus nuclear spins. Significantly, the all-to-all connectivity of the nuclear spins provided by the hyperfine interaction not only allows for efficient multi-qubit operations, but also provides individual qubit addressability. Together with the long coherence times of the nuclear and electron spins, this results in all four single qubit fidelities above 99.9% and controlled-Z gates between all pairs of nuclear spins above 99% fidelity. The high control fidelities, combined with >99% fidelity readout of all nuclear spins, allows for the creation of a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state with 96.2% fidelity, the highest reported for semiconductor spin qubits so far.

Wierda, Daniele Gaggero, Bradley J. Kavanagh, Marta Volonteri, Naoki Yoshida","Dark matter overdensities around black holes can be searched for by looking at the characteristic imprint they leave on the gravitational waveform of binary black hole mergers. Current theoretical predictions of the density profile of dark matter overdensities are based on highly idealised formation scenarios, in which black holes are assumed to grow adiabatically from an infinitesimal seed to their final mass, compressing dark matter cusps at the center of galactic halos into very dense `spikes'. These scenarios were suitable for dark matter indirect detection studies, since annihilating dark matter cannot reach very high densities, but they fail to capture the dark matter distribution in the innermost regions where the gravitational wave signal is produced. We present here a more realistic formation scenario where black holes form from the collapse of supermassive stars, and follow the evolution of the dark matter density as the supermassive star grows and collapses to a black hole. We show that in this case dark matter forms shallower `mounds', instead of `spikes', on scales comparable with the size of the supermassive stars originating them.

On calculating discs structures, we compute the critical points of stability curves for discs around SMBH, which cover a wide range of accretion rates and resemble the shape of a $ξ$ curve. We find that there are values of the disc parameters that favour the transition of a disc ring from a recombined cool state to a hot, fully ionised, advection dominated, geometrically thick state with higher viscosity parameter $α$. For SMBH with masses $\sim 10^6-10^8 M_\odot$, such a flare can occur in the geometrically thin and optically thick neutral disc with convective energy transfer through the disc thickness surrounding a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. When self-gravity effects are negligible, the duration of a flare and the associated mass exhibit a positive correlation with the truncation radius of the geometrically thin disc prior to the flare. According to our rough estimates, $\sim 4-3000 M_\odot$ can be involved in a giant flare, i.e. can be accreted or entrained with an outflow lasting 1 to 400 years, if the flare is triggered somewhere between $60$ and $600$ gravitational radii in a disc around SMBH with $10^7 M_\odot$. The accretion rate on SMBH peaks at a super-Eddington value about ten times faster. The peak effective disc temperature at the trigger radius is $\sim 10^5\,$K, but it can be obscured by an optically thick outflow that reprocesses the emission to longer wavelengths.

However, the chemical space of HEAs is exponentially vast with respect to the number of constituent elements, and even screening calculations using machine learning potentials can be enormously time-consuming. To address this challenge, we propose a method to rapidly construct models that predict the properties of HEAs from data on monometallic systems (or few-component alloys). The core of our approach is a newly-introduced descriptor called local surface energy ($LSE$), which reflects the local reactivity of solid surfaces at atomic resolution. We successfully created a model using linear regression to screen the adsorption energies of molecules on HEAs based on LSEs from monometallic systems.

Thermodynamic topology of Phantom AdS Black Holes in Massive Gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08243v1,"Hao Chen, Meng-Yao Zhang, Hassan Hassanabadi, Zheng-Wen Long","In this work, we explore the thermodynamic topology of phantom AdS black holes in the context of massive gravity. To this end, we evaluate these black holes in two distinct ensembles: the canonical and grand canonical ensembles (GCE). We begin by examining the topological charge linked to the critical point and confirming the existence of a conventional critical point $(CP_{1})$ in the canonical ensemble (CE), this critical point has a topological charge of $-1$ and acts as a point of phase annihilation, this situation can only be considered within the context of the classical Einstein-Maxwell (CEM) theory $(η=1)$, while no critical point is identified in the GCE. Furthermore, we consider black holes as a topological defect within the thermodynamic space. To gain an understanding of the local and global topological configuration of this defect, we will analyze its winding numbers, and observe that the total topological charge in the CE consistently remains at $1$. When the system experiences a pressure below the critical threshold, it gives rise to the occurrence of annihilation and generation points. The value of electric potential determines whether the total topological charge in the GCE is zero or one. As a result, we detect a point of generation point or absence of generation/annihilation point. Based on our analysis, it can be inferred that ensembles significantly impact the topological class of phantom AdS black holes in massive gravity.",{'black holes': 4},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Searching for Hyper-compact star clusters in the Milky Way using LAMOST and Gaia,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08234v1,"Hao Wu, Haibo Yuan, Yilun Wang, Zexi Niu, Huawei Zhang","During the early merger of the Milky Way, intermediate-mass black holes in merged dwarf galaxies may have been ejected from the center of their host galaxies due to gravitational waves, carrying some central stars along. This process can lead to the formation of hyper-compact star clusters, potentially hosting black holes in the mass range of $10^4$ to $10^5$ solar masses. These clusters are crucial targets for identifying and investigating intermediate-mass black holes. However, no hyper-compact star clusters in the Milky Way have been identified so far. In this paper, taking advantage of the high spatial resolution power of Gaia, we used data from Gaia EDR3 and LAMOST DR7, along with additional data from Pan-STARRS and SDSS, to conduct an initial screening of 6,138,049 sources using various parameters of Gaia EDR3. A total of 4,786 sources were selected for in-depth analysis. Each of these sources was meticulously scrutinized by examining their images, spectra, and nearby celestial objects to exclude various false positives, such as contaminations, galaxies, wide binaries, or wrong matches.

Fully quantum arbitrarily varying channel coding for entanglement-assisted communication,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08200v1,Paula Belzig,"If a sender and a receiver lack precise knowledge about the communication line that connects them, designing a scheme to reliably transmit information becomes more challenging. This has been studied in classical and quantum information theory in the context of compound channel models and arbitrarily varying channel models. However, a fully quantum version of system uncertainty allows for an even more challenging coding scenario with entangled channel uses. This type of model has previously been investigated for classical and quantum capacity. Here, we address the problem of entanglement-assisted capacity in the presence of such system uncertainty. We find that, under the assumption of a finite environment dimension, it is equal to a corresponding compound capacity. Intriguingly, our results imply that in certain fully quantum arbitrarily varying channel models, the entanglement-assisted capacity can be positive while the classical capacity is equal to zero, a phenomenon that does not occur in regular single-channel coding.",{'quantum information theory': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Eccentricity matters: Impact of eccentricity on inferred binary black hole populations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08185v1,"Muhammad Zeeshan, Richard O'Shaughnessy","Gravitational waves (GW), emanating from binary black holes (BBH), encode vital information about their source. GW signals enable us to deduce key properties of the BBH population across the universe, including mass, spin, and eccentricity distribution. While the masses and spins of binary components are already recognized for their insights into formation, eccentricity stands out as a distinct and quantifiable indicator of formation and evolution. Yet, despite its significance, eccentricity is notably absent from most parameter estimation (PE) analyses associated with GW signals. To evaluate the precision with which the eccentricity distribution can be deduced, we generated two synthetic populations of eccentric binary black holes (EBBH) characterized by non-spinning, non-precessing dynamics and mass ranges between $10 M_\odot$ and $50 M_\odot$. This was achieved using an eccentric power law model, encompassing $100$ events with eccentricity distributions set at $σ_ε= 0.05$ and $σ_ε= 0.15$. This synthetic EBBH ensemble was contrasted against a circular binary black holes (CBBH) collection to discern how parameter inferences would vary without eccentricity. Employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, we constrained vital model parameters, including the event rate ($\mathcal{R}$), mass distribution, minimum mass ($m_{min}$), maximum mass ($m_{max}$), and the eccentricity distribution ($σ_ε$). Our analysis demonstrates that eccentric population inference can identify the signatures of even modest eccentricities, given sufficiently many events. Conversely, our study shows that an analysis neglecting eccentricity may draw biased conclusions about population parameters for populations with the optimistic values of eccentricity distribution used in our research.",{'black holes': 3},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We focus mainly on binary formation between stellar-mass black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNi), considering both gas dynamical friction from AGN disks and stellar dynamical friction from the nuclear star cluster. We first find simple, dimensionless friction coefficients that approximate the effects of standard models for gas and stellar dynamical friction. We perform extensive simulations of Hill's problem under such friction, and we present a picture of binary formation through encounters between single stars on nearby orbits, as a function of friction parameter, eccentricity, and inclination. Notably, we find that the local binary formation rate is a linear function of the friction coefficient so long as the friction is weak. Due to the dimensionless nature of our model problem, our findings are generalizable to binary formation at all scales (e.g., intermediate-mass black holes in a star cluster, planetesimals in a gaseous disk).",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Feedback is a required component of galaxy formation models and simulations to explain observed properties of galaxy populations. We provide a broad overview of observational approaches that are designed to establish the physical processes that couple AGN energy to the multi-phase gas, or to find evidence that AGN impact upon galaxy evolution. The orders-of-magnitude range in spatial, temporal, and temperature scales, requires a diverse set of observational studies. For example, studying individual targets in detail sheds light on coupling mechanisms; however, evidence for long-term impact of AGN is better established within galaxy populations that are not necessarily currently active. We emphasise how modern surveys have revealed the importance of radio emission for identifying, and characterising, feedback mechanisms. At the achieved sensitivities, the detected radio emission can trace a range of processes, including shocked interstellar medium caused by AGN outflows (driven by various mechanisms including radiation pressure, accretion disc winds, and jets).

Gravitational wave pulse and memory effects for hairy Kiselev black hole and its analogy with Bondi-Sachs formalism,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08026v1,"H. Hadi, Amin Rezaei Akbarieh, David F. Mota","The investigation of non-vacuum cosmological backgrounds containing black holes is greatly enhanced by the Kiselev solution. This solution plays a crucial role in understanding the properties of the background and its relationship with the features of the black hole. Consequently, the gravitational memory effects at large distances from the black hole offer a valuable means of obtaining information about the surrounding field parameter N and parameters related to the hair of the hairy Kiselev Black hole. This paper investigates the gravitational memory effects in the context of the Kiselev solution through two distinct approaches. At first, the gravitational memory effect at null infinity is explored by utilizing the Bondi-Sachs formalism by introducing a gravitational wave (GW) pulse to the solution. The resulting Bondi mass is then analyzed to gain further insight. Therefore, the Kiselev solution is being examined to determine the variations in Bondi mass caused by the pulse of GWs. The study of changes in Bondi mass is motivated by the fact that it is dynamic and time-dependent, and it measures mass on an asymptotically null slice or the densities of energy on celestial spheres. In the second approach, the investigation of displacement and velocity memory effects is undertaken in relation to the deviation of two neighboring geodesics and the deviation of their derivative influenced by surrounding field parameter N and the hair of hairy Kiselev black hole. This analysis is conducted within the context of a gravitational wave pulse present in the background of a hairy Kiselev black hole surrounded by a field parameter N.","{'black holes': 1, 'geodesics': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the ``thunder'') and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the ``lightning'') BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.","{'black holes': 1, 'geodesics': 2}",04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Previous studies often focus on the transient emission produced by embedded sBHs. Here, we explore the possible observational consequences of an AGN accretion disk that contains a population of accreting sBHs. Embedded accreting sBHs change the effective temperature distribution of the AGN accretion disk by heating gas in the outer regions. Two possible observational consequences are presented. First, the spectral energy distribution has a turnover feature at $\sim 4700\ \textrmÅ$ when the supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass is $\sim 10^8\ M_{\odot}$, which can help explain the observed shallow spectral shape at wavelengths $>5000\ \textrmÅ$ for the Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasar composite spectrum. Second, the half-light radius of a given relatively long wavelength is significantly larger than for an AGN disk without sBHs, which can be tested by microlensing observations. With appropriate sBH distributions, the model can be reconciled with quasar microlensing disk sizes.

On the nature of inner light-rings,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07357v1,Francesco Di Filippo,"Non-singular horizonless ultracompact objects provide a simple resolution to the black holes singularity problem. It has been shown that, if these objects are compact enough to exhibit the presence of the light-ring required to mimic the phenomenology of general relativity black holes, they must have at least one additional light-ring. The stability of the inner light ring has been proven under the assumption of Einstein equations and the validity of the null energy condition. Since this can have important repercussions on the instability of a horizonless ultracompact object and the existence of the latter requires some modified gravitational dynamics and/or exotic matter, it is desirable to obtain a model-independent proof of the stability of the additional light-ring. In this paper, we prove the stability of the inner light-ring without any assumption on the dynamics of the theory, while assuming that the outer light-ring has the same properties as the Kerr light-ring. Given the stringent observational constraints on the geometry at the outer light-ring scale, our result now rests solely on geometric considerations and applies to any theory of gravity with any matter content that cannot be ruled out by observations.","{'black holes': 2, 'einstein equations': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

In particular, when the Universe was $\sim 1$ s in age, Electron-Positron Annihilation (EPA) took place. We explore the formation of intermediate mass and supermassive PBHs, taking into account the effect of the EPA when the fluctuations have a running-tilt power-law spectrum: when these cross the $10^{-0.5}$-$10^{3.0}$ s Universe horizon they could produce $5\times 10^{3}$ - $5\times 10^{8}M_{\odot}$ PBHs with a density as high as $\sim 10^{10}$/Gpc$^3$.

This result is established by a new technique that relates certification to the mixing time of a random walk. Our protocol has applications for benchmarking quantum systems, for optimizing quantum circuits to generate a desired target state, and for learning and verifying neural networks, tensor networks, and various other representations of quantum states using only single-qubit measurements.

Bounds and guarantees for learning and entanglement,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07277v1,Evan Peters,"Information theory provides tools to predict the performance of a learning algorithm on a given dataset. For instance, the accuracy of learning an unknown parameter can be upper bounded by reducing the learning task to hypothesis testing for a discrete random variable, with Fano's inequality then stating that a small conditional entropy between a learner's observations and the unknown parameter is necessary for successful estimation. This work first extends this relationship by demonstrating that a small conditional entropy is also sufficient for successful learning, thereby establishing an information-theoretic lower bound on the accuracy of a learner. This connection between information theory and learning suggests that we might similarly apply quantum information theory to characterize learning tasks involving quantum systems. Observing that the fidelity of a finite-dimensional quantum system with a maximally entangled state (the singlet fraction) generalizes the success probability for estimating a discrete random variable, we introduce an entanglement manipulation task for infinite-dimensional quantum systems that similarly generalizes classical learning. We derive information-theoretic bounds for succeeding at this task in terms of the maximal singlet fraction of an appropriate finite-dimensional discretization.

Accretion Flares from Stellar Collisions in Galactic Nuclei,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07255v1,"Betty X. Hu, Avi Loeb","The strong tidal force in a supermassive black hole's (SMBH) vicinity, coupled with a higher stellar density at the center of a galaxy, make it an ideal location to study the interaction between stars and black holes. Two stars moving near the SMBH could collide at a very high speed, which can result in a high energy flare. The resulting debris can then accrete onto the SMBH, which could be observed as a separate event. We simulate the light curves resulting from the fallback accretion in the aftermath of a stellar collision near a SMBH. We investigate how it varies with physical parameters of the system. With all other physical parameters of the system held constant, the direction of the relative velocity vector at time of impact plays a large role in determining the overall form of the light curve. One distinctive light curve we notice is characterized by a sustained increase in the luminosity some time after accretion has started. We compare this form to the light curves of some candidate tidal disruption events (TDEs). Stellar collision accretion flares can take on unique appearances that would allow them to be easily distinguished, as well as elucidate underlying physical parameters of the system.

The Effects of Stellar and AGN Feedback on the Cosmic Star Formation History in the Simba Simulations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07252v1,"Lucie Scharré, Daniele Sorini, Romeel Davé","Using several variants of the cosmological Simba simulations, we investigate the impact of different feedback prescriptions on the cosmic star formation history. Adopting a global-to-local approach, we link signatures seen in global observables, such as the star formation rate density (SFRD) and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF), to feedback effects in individual galaxies. We find a consistent picture: stellar feedback mainly suppresses star formation below halo masses of $M_{\rm H} = 10^{12} \rm \, M_{\odot}$ and before $z = 2$, whereas AGN feedback quenches the more massive systems after $z = 2$. Among Simba's AGN feedback modes, AGN jets are the dominant quenching mechanism and set the shape of the SFRD and the GSMF at late times. AGN-powered winds only suppress the star formation rate in intermediate-mass galaxies ($M_{\rm \star} = 10^{9.5 - 10} \rm \, M_{\odot}$), without affecting the overall stellar mass-assembly significantly. At late times, the AGN X-ray feedback mode mainly quenches residual star formation in massive galaxies. Our analysis reveals that this mode is also necessary to produce the first fully quenched galaxies before $z=2$, where the jets alone are inefficient. These initially highly star-forming galaxies contain relatively large black holes, likely strengthening the X-ray-powered heating and ejection of gas from the dense, central region of galaxies. Such extra heating source quenches the local star formation and produces a more variable accretion rate. More generally, this effect also causes the break down of correlations between the specific star formation rate, the accretion rate and the black hole mass.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We observe that the spectrum contains massive frequency degeneracies, and the weighting coefficients for the modes are highly structured, thus limiting model expressivity. Our results provide a step towards understanding models based on quantum data, and contribute to fundamental knowledge needed for building efficient quantum machine learning (QML) protocols. As non-trivial embeddings are crucial for designing QML protocols that cannot be simulated classically, our findings guide the search for high-capacity quantum models that can largely outperform classical models.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We show that by reformulating the way the fermionic anti-symmetry is handled, we arrive at MPS with a level of entanglement comparable to the usual one found in second quantization. We demonstrate our scheme on the one-dimensional $t$-$V$ model (spinless fermions with nearest neighbour density-density interaction) for both ground state and time evolution.

Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07055v1,"Che-Yu Chen, Hung-Yi Pu","The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

In recent years, simulations of large molecules through VQE or dynamics of many-body spin Hamiltonians may be possible, and even able to achieve useful results with the use of error mitigation techniques. Simulating smaller models is also important, and currently, in the NISQ (Noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era, it is easier and less prone to errors. This current study encompasses the theoretical background and the hardware aware circuit implementation of a quantum tunneling simulation. Specifically, this study presents the theoretical background needed for such implementation and highlights the main steps of development. Building on classic approaches of quantum tunneling simulations, this study improves the result of such simulations by employing error mitigation techniques (ZNE and REM) and uses them in conjunction with multiprogramming of the quantum chip for solving the hardware under-utilization problem that arises in such contexts.

Ensemble power spectral density of SDSS quasars in UV/optical bands,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06983v1,"Vincenzo Petrecca, Iossif Papadakis, Maurizio Paolillo, Demetra De Cicco, Franz Bauer","Context: Quasar variability has proven to be a powerful tool to constrain the properties of their inner engine and the accretion process onto supermassive black holes. Correlations between UV/optical variability and physical properties have been long studied with a plethora of different approaches and time-domain surveys, although the detailed picture is not yet clear. Aims: We analysed archival data from the SDSS Stripe-82 region to study how the quasar power spectral density (PSD) depends on the black hole mass, bolometric luminosity, accretion rate, redshift, and rest-frame wavelength. We developed a model-independent analysis framework that could be easily applied to upcoming large surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Methods: We used light curves of 8042 spectroscopically confirmed quasars, observed in at least six yearly seasons in five filters ugriz. We split the sample into bins of similar physical properties containing at least 50 sources, and we measured the ensemble PSD in each of them. Results: We find that a simple power law is a good fit to the power spectra in the frequency range explored. Variability does not depend on redshift at a fixed wavelength. Instead, both PSD amplitude and slope depend on the black hole mass, accretion rate, and rest-frame wavelength. We provide scaling relations to model the observed variability as a function of the physical properties, and discuss the possibility of a universal PSD shape for all quasars, where frequencies scale with the black hole mass, while normalization and slope(s) are fixed (at any given wavelength and accretion rate).",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

This study is motivated by observations from the Event Horizon Telescope collaboration, which does not exclude the possibility of the existence of such black holes. Through these inquiries, we uncover that the electric charge may significantly impact the scalar field profile and the density profile in the vecinty of the black hole. For the maximum electric charge allowed by the constraints of the Event Horizon Telescope, the maximum accretion rate decreases by $\thicksim$ 50 \% compared to the Schwarszchild case for marginally bound orbits. The maximum accretion rate of the massive scalar field is approximately $\dot M_{\text{SFDM}} \thicksim 10^{-8} M_{\odot} \;\text{yr}^{-1}$, which is significantly lower than the typical baryonic accretion rate commonly found in the literature.

Significant PSF variations across the field of view invalidate the approach of deconvolution with a mean PSF or on-axis PSF. The ignoring of PSF variations can be especially unsatisfactory in the case of Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics (SCAO) observations, as these sophisticated and expensive systems are designed to achieve high resolution with ground-based telescopes by correcting for atmospheric turbulence in the direction of one reference star.

On the central singularity of the BTZ geometries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06552v1,"Matías Briceño, Cristián Martínez, Jorge Zanelli","The nature of the central singularity of the BTZ geometries -- stationary vacuum solutions of 2+1 gravity with negative cosmological constant $Λ=-\ell^{-2}$ and $SO(2)\times \mathbb{R}$ isometry -- is discussed. The essential tool for this analysis is the holonomy operator on a closed path (i.e., Wilson loop) around the central singularity. The study considers the holonomies for the Lorentz and AdS$_3$ connections. The analysis is carried out for all values of the mass $M$ and angular momentum $J$, namely, for black holes ($M \ell \ge |J|$) and naked singularities ($M \ell < |J|$). In general, both Lorentz and AdS$_3$ holonomies are nontrivial in the zero-radius limit revealing the presence of delta-like singularity at the origin in the curvature and torsion two-forms.

Ladder Symmetries and Love Numbers of Reissner--Nordström Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06544v1,"Mudit Rai, Luca Santoni","It is well known that asymptotically flat black holes in general relativity have vanishing tidal Love numbers. In the case of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes, this property has been shown to be a consequence of a hidden structure of ladder symmetries for the perturbations. In this work, we extend the ladder symmetries to non-rotating charged black holes in general relativity. As opposed to previous works in this context, we adopt a more general definition of Love numbers, including quadratic operators that mix gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations in the point-particle effective field theory. We show that the calculation of a subset of those couplings in full general relativity is affected by an ambiguity in the split between source and response, which we resolve through an analytic continuation. As a result, we derive a novel master equation that unifies scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations around Reissner--Nordström black holes. The equation is hypergeometric and can be obtained from previous formulations via nontrivial field redefinitions, which allow to systematically remove some of the singularities and make the presence of the ladder symmetries more manifest.",{'black holes': 4},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false vacuum islands,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06506v2,"Rong-Gen Cai, Yu-Shi Hao, Shao-Jiang Wang","Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today.

In this paper, we simulate 341 progenitors at three different metallicities using spherically symmetric simulations that include neutrino-driven convection via a mixing-length theory. We use these simulations to improve previously derived explosion criteria based on the density and entropy profiles of the pre-supernova progenitor. We also provide numerical fits to calculate the final mass of neutron stars based on either compactness, the location of the Si/Si-O interface, or the Chandrasekhar mass. The neutron star birth mass distribution derived from our 1D+ simulations is bimodal, contrary to what the most popular 1D CCSN simulations have shown so far. We compare the theoretically derived neutron star mass distributions with the observed ones and discuss potential implications for population synthesis studies. We also analyze the black hole mass distribution predicted by our simulations. To be consistent with current models of matter ejection in failed SNe, a large fraction of the envelope must be expelled, leading to small black holes in the low-mass gap. One black hole in this mass region has recently been observed in the GW230529 event by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration. Our results naturally agree with this detection, which the most popular prescriptions for explodability and remnant masses are not able to reproduce.

We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.",{'tensor networks': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Tensor Networks']
GW230529_181500: A Potential Primordial Binary Black Hole Merger in the Mass Gap,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05691v1,"Qing-Guo Huang, Chen Yuan, Zu-Cheng Chen, Lang Liu","During the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA detector network, the LIGO Livingston observatory detected a coalescing compact binary, GW230529_181500, with component masses of $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ at the $90\%$ credible level. The gravitational-wave data alone is insufficient to determine whether the components are neutron stars or black holes. In this paper, we propose that GW230529_181500 originated from the merger of two primordial black holes (PBHs). We estimate a merger rate of $5.0^{+47.0}_{-4.9} \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to GW230529_181500. Assuming the source is a PBH-PBH merger, GW230529-like events lead to approximately $1.7^{+36.2}_{-1.5} \times 10^{-3}$ of the dark matter in the form of PBHs. The required abundance of PBHs to explain this event is consistent with existing upper limits derived from microlensing, cosmic microwave background observations and the null detection of gravitational wave background by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Free from the fermion sign problem, ChePSMPS enhances its ability to explore $e$-ph effects and generate high-resolution spectral functions in doped Mott insulators. We use this method to simulate the spectra for both one- and two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein models, highlighting its superiority over other methods.

Complex network approach to the turbulent velocity gradient dynamics: High- and low-probability Lagrangian paths,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05453v1,"Christopher J. Keylock, Maurizio Carbone","Understanding the dynamics of the turbulent velocity gradient tensor (VGT) is essential to gain insights into the Navier-Stokes equations and improve small-scale turbulence modeling. However, characterizing the VGT dynamics conditional on all its relevant invariants in a continuous fashion is extremely difficult. In this paper, we represent the VGT Lagrangian dynamics using a network where each node represents a unique flow state. This approach enables us to discern how the VGT transitions from one state to another in a simplified fashion. Our analysis reveals intriguing features of the resulting network, such as the clustering of the commonly visited nodes where the eigenvalues of the VGT are real, in the proximity of the Vieillefosse tail. We then relate our complex network approach to the well-established VGT discretization based on the sign of its principal invariants, $Q$ and $R$, and its discriminant, $Δ$. To this end, we separate the shortest paths on the network (geodesics) based on the $Q$-$R$ region to which their starting and arrival nodes belong. The distribution of the length of intra-region geodesics, with starting and arrival nodes belonging to the same $Q$-$R$ region, exhibits a distinct bimodality in two regions of the $Q$-$R$ plane, those in which the deviatoric part of the pressure Hessian introduces complexity to the VGT dynamics. Such bimodality is associated with infrequently visited nodes having to follow a long, low probability path to drastically change the state of the VGT compared to other flow states that can acquire the necessary characteristics without changing their sign for $Q$ or $R$. We complement the geodesics approach by examining random walks on the network, showing how the VGT non-normality and the associated production terms distinguish the shortest commuting paths between different $Q$-$R$ regions.",{'geodesics': 3},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum Annealers Chain Strengths: A Simple Heuristic to Set Them All,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05443v1,"Valentin Gilbert, Stéphane Louise","Quantum annealers (QA), such as D-Wave systems, become increasingly efficient and competitive at solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, solving problems that do not directly map the chip topology remains challenging for this type of quantum computer. The creation of logical qubits as sets of interconnected physical qubits overcomes limitations imposed by the sparsity of the chip at the expense of increasing the problem size and adding new parameters to optimize. This paper explores the advantages and drawbacks provided by the structure of the logical qubits and the impact of the rescaling of coupler strength on the minimum spectral gap of Ising models. We show that densely connected logical qubits require a lower chain strength to maintain the ferromagnetic coupling. We also analyze the optimal chain strength variations considering different minor embeddings of the same instance. This experimental study suggests that the chain strength can be optimized for each instance. We design a heuristic that optimizes the chain strength using a very low number of shots during the pre-processing step. This heuristic outperforms the default method used to initialize the chain strength on D-Wave systems, increasing the quality of the best solution by up to 17.2% for tested instances on the max-cut problem.",{'quantum computer': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Solving quantum impurity problems on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05410v2,"Ruofan Chen, Chu Guo","The path integral formalism is the building block of many powerful numerical methods for quantum impurity problems. However, existing fermionic path integral based numerical calculations have only been performed in either the imaginary-time or the real-time axis, while the most generic scenario formulated on the L-shaped Kadanoff-Baym contour is left unexplored. In this work, we extended the recently developed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method to solve quantum impurity problems directly on the Kadanoff-Baym contour. The resulting method is numerically exact, with only two sources of numerical errors, e.g., the time discretization error and the matrix product state bond truncation error, which can both be well controlled. The accuracy of this method is numerically demonstrated against exact solutions in the noninteracting case, and against existing calculations on the real- and imaginary-time axes for the single-orbital Anderson impurity model. Our method is a perfect benchmarking baseline for its alternatives which often employ less-controlled approximations, and can also be used as a real-time impurity solver in dynamical mean field theory and its non-equilibrium extension.",{'matrix product state': 1},04.2024,2024,04,[]

Massless limit and conformal soft limit for celestial massive amplitudes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05137v2,Wei Fan,"In celestial holography, the massive and massless scalars in 4d space-time are represented by the Fourier transform of the bulk-to-boundary propagators and the Mellin transform of plane waves respectively. Recently, the 3pt celestial amplitude of one massive scalar and two massless scalars was discussed in arXiv:2312.08597. In this paper, we compute the 3pt celestial amplitude of two massive scalars and one massless scalar. Then we take the massless limit $m\to 0$ for one of the massive scalars, during which process the gamma function $Γ(1-Δ)$ appears. By requiring the resulting amplitude to be well-defined, that is it goes to the 3pt amplitude of arXiv:2312.08597, the scaling dimension of this massive scalar has to be conformally soft $Δ\to 1$. The pole $1/(1-Δ)$ coming from $Γ(1-Δ)$ is crucial for this massless limit. Without it the resulting amplitude would be zero. This can be compared with the conformal soft limit in celestial gluon amplitudes, where a singularity $1/(Δ-1)$ arises and the leading contribution comes from the soft energy $ω\to 0$. The phase factors in the massless limit of massive conformal primary wave functions, dicussed in arXiv:1705.01027, plays an import and consistent role in the celestial massive amplitudes. In this massless limit, the subleading terms $m^{2n}$ can also contribute poles when the scaling dimension is analytically continued to $Δ=1-n$.",{'holography': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Holography']

We focused on the quantum effects on the location of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO), the energy flux from the disk, the disk temperature, the observed redshifted luminosity, and the accretion efficiency. The deviations from the classical general relativity due to quantum effects are described for a free parameter that arises in the improved Kerr metric as a consequence of the fact that the Newton constant turns into a running coupling $G(r)$ depending on the energy scale. We find that, both for rapid and slow rotating black holes with accretion disks in prograde and retrograde circulation, increases in the value of this parameter are accompanied by a decreasing of the ISCO, by a lifting of the peaks of the radiation properties of the disk and by an increase of the accretion mass efficiency, as compared with the predictions of general relativity.

In this work, we unleash the full power of GTEMPO for zero-temperature imaginary-time calculations: the multi-time impurity state is time-translationally invariant with infinite boundary condition, therefore it can be represented as an infinite Grassmann matrix product state (GMPS) with nontrivial unit cell in a single time step, instead of an open boundary GMPS spanning the whole imaginary-time axis. We devise a very efficient infinite GTEMPO algorithm targeted at zero-temperature equilibrium quantum impurity problems, which is known to be a hard regime for quantum Monte Carlo methods.

A systematic approach to celestial holography: a case study in Einstein gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04637v1,"Wei Bu, Sean Seet","We propose a systematic approach to celestial holography in massless theories beginning by studying the implications of properly incorporating field configurations built using the eigenstates of central interest: massless conformal primary wavefunctions that diagonalize the dilatation generator. Due to their singular behaviour on the locus $k\cdot x=0$, they do not belong to the space of Fourier decomposable functions, and incorporating them in the path integral domain requires careful manipulations. In this paper, we include these singular field configurations by a splitting procedure using large pure gauge/diffeomorphism transformations on the action functional. We demonstrate that doing so splits the action into an integrand supported on the singular locus $k\cdot x=0$ and an integrand on the rest of the space. Mellin transforms single out the scalings/conformal dimension in $x$, geometrically, we treat this as a proper non-compact scaling reduction, where we are able to further isolate the dynamics of the large pure diffeomorphism transformations. This takes the form of 2d chiral CFT on a 2d sphere on the singular locus $k\cdot x=0$ - the celestial sphere where the null cone of the origin cuts $\mathscr{I}$. Using this framework, we study Einstein gravity perturbatively around its self-dual sector, where the resulting microscopic 2d CFT couples to bulk scattering states. We are able to obtain an explicit representation of the $\mathcal{L} w_{1+\infty}$ algebra and leading soft splitting functions.

Local Test for Unitarily Invariant Properties of Bipartite Quantum States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04599v2,"Kean Chen, Qisheng Wang, Zhicheng Zhang","We study the power of local test for bipartite quantum states. Our central result is that, for properties of bipartite pure states, unitary invariance on one part implies an optimal (over all global testers) local tester acting only on the other part. This suggests a canonical local tester for entanglement spectra (i.e., Schmidt coefficients), and reveals that purified samples offer no advantage in property testing of mixed states. As applications, we show new sample lower bounds, e.g.:
  - The first general lower bound $Ω(r/ε^2)$ for testing whether the Schmidt rank of a bipartite state is at most $r$ or $ε$-far, settling an open question raised in Montanaro and de Wolf (ToC 2016).

Apart from the mass of the black hole (M), among the most interesting characteristics is the spin (a), which determines the degree of rotation, i.e., the angular momentum of the black hole. The latter is observationally constrained by the spectral and timing properties of the radiation signal emerging from an accretion disk of matter orbiting near the event horizon. In the case of planar (standard, equatorial) accretion disk, it is the location of the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) that determines the observable radiation characteristics, and this way allows us to measure the spin. In this paper, we discuss a more general case of the Innermost Stable Spherical Orbits (ISSO) extending above and below the equatorial plane. To this end, we study the non-equatorial geodesic motion of particles following inclined, spherical, relativistically precessing trajectories with the aim of exploring the boundary between the regions of stable (energetically bound) and escaping (energetically unbound) motion. The concept of the ISSO radius should play a role in determining the inner rim of a tilted or geometrically thick accretion flow.

We estimate a merger rate density of $55^{+127}_{-47}~\text{Gpc}^{-3}\,\text{yr}^{-1}$ for compact binary coalescences with properties similar to the source of GW230529_181500; assuming that the source is a neutron star-black hole merger, GW230529_181500-like sources constitute about 60% of the total merger rate inferred for neutron star-black hole coalescences. The discovery of this system implies an increase in the expected rate of neutron star-black hole mergers with electromagnetic counterparts and provides further evidence for compact objects existing within the purported lower mass gap.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
A no-go result for pure state synthesis in the DQC1 model,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04198v1,Zachary Stier,"We study the problem of state synthesis in the DQC1 (One Clean Qubit) model of quantum computation, which provides a single pure qubit and $n$ maximally mixed qubits, and after applying any quantum circuit some subset of the qubits are measured or discarded. In the case of discarding, we show that it is impossible to prepare additional pure qubits, and that it is impossible to prepare very low-temperature Gibbs states on additional qubits. In the case of measurements, we show that the probability of synthesizing $m$ additional qubits is bounded by $2^{1-m}$, and that the probability of preparing low-temperature Gibbs states is bounded by $2^{2-m}$.

"Review on Quantum Walk Computing: Theory, Implementation, and Application",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04178v1,"Xiaogang Qiang, Shixin Ma, Haijing Song","Classical random walk formalism shows a significant role across a wide range of applications. As its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk is proposed as an important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting the quantum effects such as superposition, interference and entanglement, quantum walks and their variety have been extensively studied for achieving beyond classical computing power, and they have been broadly used in designing quantum algorithms in fields ranging from algebraic and optimization problems, graph and network analysis, to quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process simulations, and even further quantum walk models have proven their capabilities for universal quantum computation. Compared to the conventional quantum circuit models, quantum walks show a feasible path for implementing application-specific quantum computing in particularly the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications, demonstrating the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide a thorough summary of quantum walks and quantum walk computing, including aspects of quantum walk theories and characteristics, advances in their physical implementations and the flourishingly developed quantum walk computing applications. We also discuss the challenges facing quantum walk computing, toward realizing a practical quantum computer in the near future.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'quantum computer': 1}",04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Geodesics for mixed quantum states via their geometric mean operator,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04136v1,"Paul M. Alsing, Carlo Cafaro, Shannon Ray","We examine the geodesic between two mixed states of arbitrary dimension by means of their geometric mean operator. We utilize the fiber bundle approach by which the distance between two mixed state density operators $ρ_1$ and $ρ_2$ in the base space $M$ is given by the shortest distance in the (Hilbert Schmidt) bundle space $E$ of their purifications. The latter is well-known to be given by the Bures distance along the horizontal lift in $E$ of the geodesic between the $ρ_1$ and $ρ_2$ in $M$. The horizontal lift is that unique curve in $E$ that orthogonally traverses the fibers $F\subset E$ above the curve in $M$, and projects down onto it. We briefly review this formalism and show how it can be used to construct the intermediate mixed quantum states $ρ(s)$ along the base space geodesic parameterized by affine parameter $s$ between the initial $ρ_1$ and final $ρ_2$ states. We emphasize the role played by geometric mean operator $M(s) = ρ_1^{-1/2}\, \sqrt{ρ_1^{1/2}ρ(s)ρ_1^{1/2}}\,ρ_1^{-1/2}$, where the Uhlmann root fidelity between $ρ_1$ and $ρ(s)$ is given by $\sqrt{F}(ρ_1,ρ(s)) = Tr[M(s)\,ρ_1] = Tr[\sqrt{ρ_1^{1/2}ρ(s)ρ_1^{1/2}}]$, and $ρ(s) = M(s)\,ρ_1\,M(s)$. We give examples for the geodesic between the maximally mixed state and a pure state in arbitrary dimensions, as well as for the geodesic between Werner states $ρ(p) = (1-p) I/N + p\,|Ψ\rangle\langle Ψ|$ with $|Ψ\rangle = \{|GHZ\rangle, |W\rangle\}$ in dimension $N=2^3$. For the latter, we compare expressions in the limit $p\to1$ to the infinite number of possible geodesics between the orthogonal pure states $|GHZ\rangle$ and $|W\rangle$. Lastly, we compute the analytic form for the density matrices along the geodesic that connects two arbitrary endpoint qubit density matrices within the Bloch ball for dimension $N=2$.",{'geodesics': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Explorations in Precision Holography and Higher-derivative Supergravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04134v1,Robert J. Saskowski,"This thesis explores topics related to the study of quantum gravity, with a focus on precision holography and higher-derivative supergravity. First, we study subleading corrections to the free energy of a particular 3D N=3 Chern-Simons-matter theory found by Gaiotto and Tomasiello, which is given by a matrix model after supersymmetric localization. This theory is dual to massive IIA supergravity on AdS4, and consequently, the structure of subleading corrections to the field theory naturally elucidates the higher-derivative corrections to the gravity dual. We extract the first order of corrections to the free energy using resolvent methods, and our results imply that particular terms in the supergravity action should vanish on-shell. Next, we consider the unreasonable effectiveness of five-dimensional minimal gauged supergravity. There are three independent supersymmetric four-derivative terms that one can add to the action; nevertheless, after going on-shell (or, equivalently, after a field redefinition that pushes the off-shell discrepancies to six-derivative order), there is a unique supersymmetric invariant. Third, we consider the effect of higher-derivative corrections in holographic renormalization group flows across dimensions. In particular, we construct a local holographic c-function out of metric functions and show its monotonicity via the Null Energy Condition. We also construct a c-function from the entanglement entropy for flows with a CFT2 IR fixed point, and we show that such flows are monotonic. Finally, we consider consistent truncations of four-derivative heterotic supergravity. In particular, we show that reducing both on a torus $T^n$ or on $S^3$ and truncating the vector multiplets is indeed a consistent truncation at the four-derivative level. Moreover, we find examples of two-derivative consistent truncations which fail to extend to four-derivative ones.",{'holography': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Holography']

The Critical Mass Ratio for W UMa-type Contact Binary Systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03821v1,"Bojan Arbutina, Surjit Wadhwa","Contact binaries are close binary systems in which both components fill their inner Roche lobes so that the stars are in direct contact and in potential mass and energy exchange. The most common such systems of low-mass are the so-called W UMa-type. In the last few years, there is a growing interest of the astronomical community in stellar mergers, primarily due to the detection of gravitational waves (mergers of black holes and neutron stars), but also because of an alternative model for type Ia supernovae (merger of two white dwarfs), which are again particularly important in cosmology where they played an important role in the discovery of dark energy and the accelerated expansion of the Universe. In that sense, contact systems of W UMa-type with extremely low mass ratio are especially interesting because there are indications that in their case, too, stars can merge and possible form fast-rotating stars such as FC Com stars and the blue-stragglers, and (luminous) red novae such as V1309 Sco. Namely, previous theoretical research has shown that in the cases when the orbital angular momentum of the system is only about three times larger than the rotational angular momentum of the primary, a tidal Darwin's instability occurs, the components can no longer remain in synchronous rotation, orbit continue to shrink fast and they finally merge into a single star. The above stability condition for contact systems can be linked to some critical mass ratio below which we expect a system to be unstable. We give an overview of this condition and show how it can be used to identify potential mergers. Finally, we discuss a number of known extreme mass ratio binaries from the literature and prospect for future research on this topic.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
"Geometry from geodesics: fine-tuning Ehlers, Pirani, and Schild",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03815v1,James T.

We find greater freedom for both connections, including either a 1-parameter class of projective connections, or a conformal connection for timelike curves, and conformal symmetry for null curves. Examining the effect of every member of both the projective class and the conformal transformations on the curvature, torsion, nonmetricity, and metric, we find the changes from the original geometry. Forming invariant connections we compute both the projectively and conformally invariant forms of the curvature, torsion, and nometricity, showing that the projective and conformal tensors depend on the same gauge vector. We prove that the conditions for projective and conformal Ricci flatness imply each other and either reduces the geometry to the original form. The different transformations depend on the same monotonic, twice differentiable function on a region of spacetime. Existence of such a function requires a region foliated by order isomorphic, totally ordered, twice differentiable timelike curves in a necessarily Lorentzian geometry. To find a geometry consistent with the allowed symmetry, we develop the real, linear, 6-dim representation of the conformal connection. Taking the simplest form of the spacetime action using this connection, we show that reductions of the system lead us back to an integrable Weyl geometry.",{'geodesics': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition.

In the present compact paper we reveal the existence, in this non-linear electrodynamic field theory, of super-extremal black-hole spacetimes that are characterized by the four degenerate functional relations $[g_{00}(r)]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[dg_{00}(r)/dr]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^2g_{00}(r)/dr^2]_ {r=r_{\text{H}}}=[d^3g_{00}(r)/dr^3]_{r=r_{\text{H}}}=0$, where $g_{00}(r)$ is the $tt$-component of the curved line element and $r_{\text{H}}$ is the black-hole horizon radius. In particular, using analytical techniques we prove that the quartically degenerate super-extremal black holes are characterized by the universal (parameter-{\it independent}) dimensionless compactness parameter $M/r_{\text{H}}={2\over3}(2γ+1)$, where $γ\equiv{_2F_1}(1/4,1;5/4;-3)$.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

On the other hand, Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter black holes violate SCC. We do a detailed scan of the parameter space of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter black holes between these two limiting families, to identify the boundary that marks the transition between solutions that respect and violate SCC. We focus our attention on linear scalar field perturbations. SCC is violated inside a (roughly) `spherical' shell of the parameter space of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter, centred at the corner that describes arbitrarily small extremal Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter solutions. Outside of this region, including the Kerr-de Sitter limit, we identify perturbation modes that decay slow enough to enforce SCC. Additionally, we do a necessary study of the quasinormal mode spectra of Kerr-Newman-de Sitter in some detail. As established in the literature, in the Kerr-de Sitter and Reissner-Nordström-de Sitter limits, we find three families of modes: de Sitter, photon sphere and near-horizon modes.

Observational evidence for neutron star kicks is substantial, yet limited for black hole natal kicks, and some proposed black hole formation scenarios result in very small kicks. Here, we report the discovery that the canonical black hole low-mass X-ray binary V404 Cygni is part of a wide hierarchical triple with a tertiary companion at least 3500 astronomical units away from the inner binary. Given the orbital configuration, the black hole likely received a sub-5 kilometer per second kick to have avoided unbinding the tertiary. This discovery reveals that at least some black holes form with nearly no natal kick. Furthermore, the tertiary in this system lends credence to evolutionary models of low-mass X-ray binaries involving a hierarchical triple structure. Remarkably, the tertiary is evolved, indicating that the system formed 3-5 billion years ago, and that the black hole has removed at least half a solar mass of matter from its evolved secondary companion. During the event in which the black hole formed, it is likely that at least half of the mass of the black hole progenitor collapsed into the black hole; it may even have undergone a complete implosion, enabling the tertiary to remain loosely bound.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Mertens, Jacopo Papalini","We work out a precise holographic duality between sine dilaton gravity, and DSSYK. More precisely, canonical quantization of sine dilaton gravity reproduces q-Schwarzian quantum mechanics, which is the auxiliary system that arises from the chord diagrams of DSSYK. The role of the chord number in DSSYK is played by the (Weyl rescaled) geodesic length in the bulk. The most puzzling aspect of reconciling DSSYK with a simple gravitational dual at the classical level is the distinction between temperature and ""fake temperature"". At the q-Schwarzian level, we clarify how this arises from the constraint that the chord number is positive. The on-shell q-Schwarzian action with the constraint reproduces the thermodynamics of DSSYK. Semi-classically, in sine dilaton gravity this translates to the insertion of a defect, from which we deduce that fake temperature is the Hawking temperature of a smooth Lorentzian black hole. We comment on several relations with dS space. One remarkable feature is that in sine dilaton gravity quantization discretizes spacetime, therefore the Hilbert space is discrete.",{'holographic duality': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Holography']

We demonstrate its effectiveness for the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, examining the dynamics of the system in both its Krylov basis and the basis of operator strings. We prove that the former basis minimises spread complexity while the latter is an eigenbasis for high dissipation.

There must be a critical compactness, above which photons cannot escape. These are black holes (henceforth BH). It took fifty years after the theory was announced before possible candidate objects were identified by observational astronomy. And another fifty years have passed, until we finally have in hand detailed and credible experimental evidence that BHs of 10 to 10^10 times the mass of the Sun exist in the Universe.

Photons are ideal quantum systems because they operate at room temperature, and photonic technologies are relatively mature.

In discrete-variable (DV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by one or more modal properties (e.g. polarization) that take on distinct values from a finite set. Quantum information is processed via operations on these modal properties and eventually measured using single photon detectors. In continuous-variable (CV) photonic quantum computation, quantum information is represented by properties of the electromagnetic field that take on any value in an interval (e.g. position). The electromagnetic field is transformed via Gaussian and non-Gaussian operations, and then detected via homodyne detection. Both CV and DV photonic quantum computation have been realized experimentally and they each have a unique set of challenges that need to be overcome to achieve scalable photonic universal quantum computation.

In this work, we fill this gap by showing how to reduce the geometry of degenerate states to the non-abelian (Wilczek-Zee) connection $A$ and a previously unexplored matrix-valued metric tensor $G$. Mathematically, this problem is equivalent to finding the $U(N)$ invariants of a configuration of subspaces in $\mathbb{C}^n$. For two subspaces, the configuration was known to be described by a set of $m$ principal angles that generalize the notion of quantum distance. For more subspaces, we find $3 m^2 - 3 m + 1$ additional independent invariants associated with each triple of subspaces. Some of them generalize the Berry-Pancharatnam phase, and some do not have analogues for 1-dimensional subspaces.

The higher (more positive) spin subpopulation is found to have a mass-spectrum without any feature at the $30-40M_{\odot}$, which is consistent with the predictions of isolated stellar binary evolution, simulations for which place the pile up due to pulsational pair-instability supernovae near $50M_{\odot}$ or higher. The other sub-population with effective spins closer to zero shows a feature at $30-40M_{\odot}$ and is consistent with binary black holes formed dynamically in globular clusters, which are expected to peak around $30M_{\odot}$. We also compute merger rates for these two subpopulations and find that they are consistent with the theoretical predictions of the corresponding formation channels.

On the Charge Algebra of Causal Diamonds in Three Dimensional Gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03014v1,Pranav Pulakkat,"Covariant phase space methods are applied to the analysis of a causal diamond in 2+1-dimensional pure Einstein gravity. It is found that the reduced phase space is parametrized by a family of charges with a dual geometrical interpretation: they are geometric observables on the corner of the diamond, and they generate diffeomorphisms. The Poisson brackets among them close into an algebra. Knowledge of the corner charges therefore permits reconstruction of the diamond geometry, which realizes a form of local holography.

Integrability of Goldilocks quantum cellular automata,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02994v1,"Logan E. Hillberry, Lorenzo Piroli, Eric Vernier, Nicole Yunger Halpern, Tomaž Prosen, Lincoln D. Carr","Goldilocks quantum cellular automata (QCA) have been simulated on quantum hardware and produce emergent small-world correlation networks. In Goldilocks QCA, a single-qubit unitary is applied to each qubit in a one-dimensional chain subject to a balance constraint: a qubit is updated if its neighbors are in opposite basis states. Here, we prove that a subclass of Goldilocks QCA -- including the one implemented experimentally -- map onto free fermions and therefore can be classically simulated efficiently. We support this claim with two independent proofs, one involving a Jordan--Wigner transformation and one mapping the integrable six-vertex model to QCA. We compute local conserved quantities of these QCA and predict experimentally measurable expectation values. These calculations can be applied to test large digital quantum computers against known solutions. In contrast, typical Goldilocks QCA have equilibration properties and quasienergy-level statistics that suggest nonintegrability. Still, the latter QCA conserve one quantity useful for error mitigation. Our work provides a parametric quantum circuit with tunable integrability properties with which to test quantum hardware.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Our numerical results indicate that these black holes all suffer from superradiant instability by the unstable quasi-bound states, regardless how small the coupling constant is. We therefore provide a new example that the superradiant stability of the Reissner-Nordström black hole is a fine-tuned result, as in the case when it is embedded in the STU supergravity model. The work is also motivated by the weak gravity conjecture since at the linear coupling constant level, the theory belongs to a subsect of four-derivative corrections in the effective field theory. Our results appear to support the notion that the black holes do decay when gravity is weaker by the correction, but the decaying halftime requires nonlinear effects and cannot be seen at the level of linear coupling constant.

For this reason, we use the Karmarkar criterion for traversable static wormhole geometry to create a wormhole shape function. The suggested shape function creates wormhole geometry that links two asymptotically flat spacetime regions and meets the necessary requirements. The embedding diagram in three-dimensional Euclidean space is also discussed in order to demonstrate the wormhole configurations. For our current analysis, we choose the suitable values of free parameters for $f(R, φ)$ gravity models to discuss the wormhole geometry. It can be observed that our proposed shape function provides the wormhole solutions with less amount of exotic matter. It can be noticed that energy conditions especially null energy conditions are violated for all considered models. The violation of energy conditions indicates the existence of exotic matter and wormhole geometry. It is concluded that the shape function acquired through the Karmarkar technique yields validated wormhole configurations with even less exotic matter correlating to the chosen $f(R, φ)$ gravity models.",{'traversable wormhole': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02940v4,"Kharanshu N. Solanki, Karim Mosani, Omkar Deshpande, Pankaj S. Joshi","A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.",{'geodesics': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Efficient Quantum Circuits for Non-Unitary and Unitary Diagonal Operators with Space-Time-Accuracy trade-offs,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02819v2,"Julien Zylberman, Ugo Nzongani, Andrea Simonetto, Fabrice Debbasch","Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e. the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e. the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e. the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation: an initial Gaussian function is prepared on a set of qubits before being evolved through the non-unitary evolution operator of the diffusion process.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Thomas, Aswin P. Vijayan","Understanding the co-evolution of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and their host galaxies remains a key challenge of extragalactic astrophysics, particularly the earliest stages at high-redshift. However, studying SMBHs at high-redshift with cosmological simulations, is challenging due to the large volumes and high-resolution required. Through its innovative simulation strategy, the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) suite of cosmological hydrodynamical zoom simulations allows us to simulate a much wider range of environments which contain SMBHs with masses extending to $M_{\bullet}>10^{9}\ M_{\odot}$ at $z=5$. In this paper, we use FLARES to study the physical properties of SMBHs and their hosts in the early Universe ($5\le\, z \le10$). FLARES predicts a sharply declining density with increasing redshift, decreasing by a factor of 100 over the range $z=5\to 10$. Comparison between our predicted bolometric luminosity function and pre-\emph{JWST} observations yield a good match. However, recent \emph{JWST} observations appear to suggest a larger contribution of SMBHs than previously observed, or predicted by FLARES. Finally, by using a re-simulation with AGN feedback disabled, we explore the impact of AGN feedback on their host galaxies. This reveals that AGN feedback results in a reduction of star formation activity, even at $z>5$, but only in the most massive galaxies. A deeper analysis reveals that AGN are also the cause of suppressed star formation in passive galaxies but that the presence of an AGN doesn't necessarily result in the suppression of star formation.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We explore environmental interactions with dark matter spikes, stellar distributions, accretion disks, and combine and compare them. We discuss the existence and properties of dark matter spikes in the presence of these environmental effects. The signatures of the environmental effects, such as the phase space flow, dephasing, deshifting of the periapse, and alignment with accretion disks, are examined. These signatures are quantified in isolated spike systems, in dry, and in wet inspirals. We generally find dark matter effects to be subdominant to the other environmental effects, but their impact on the waveform is still observable and identifiable. Lastly, the rates of inspirals and the impact of spikes are estimated. All of these results are obtained with the help of a code imripy that is published alongside.

We explore the corresponding change in the dual long-scale entanglement structures, utilizing the tools of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, conditional mutual information, and partial entanglement entropy. The results indicate that modifying the IR geometry leads to a redistribution of entanglement at scales longer than a critical length determined by the location of the IR region, with the two modified IR geometries corresponding to two opposite ways of redistribution.

In our approach, we adopt Duan's $φ$-mapping topological current theory to define a novel vector field, denoted as $φ$, whose critical points exactly correspond to the Davies point and the Hawking-Page phase transition point. More importantly, we can differentiate between these two points by their topological charge. While, the topological charge for the critical point corresponding to the Davies-type phase transition is found to be $-1$, the same for the Hawking-Page phase transition point, it is $+1$. Although our analysis is applicable to all black hole systems where both types of phase transitions are found, we illustrate it using three simple systems as examples: the Schwarzschild AdS black hole, the Reissner-Nordström AdS black hole in the grand canonical ensemble, and finally the Kerr AdS black holes in the grand canonical ensemble. It is wellknown that these black holes exhibit both Davies and Hawking-Page phase transitions.

In this paper, we study the entanglement entropy $S_n$ of the fixed length state $\{|n\rangle\}$ in Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, which has been recently shown to exhibit type II$_1$ von Neumann algebra.

In contrast, some ""massive"" black holes (mBHs; $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{5}$$-$$10^{6}~M_\odot$) in low-mass galaxies present curious X-ray properties with coronal radiative output up to 100$\times$ weaker than expected. To examine this issue, we present new and archival 10 GHz Very Large Array observations of a sample of high-accretion-rate (Eddington ratios $L_{\rm bol}/L_{\rm Edd} > 0.1$), mBH-powered AGNs with Chandra X-ray coverage. Empirical correlations previously revealed in samples of radio-quiet, high-Eddington AGNs indicate that the radio$-$X-ray luminosity ratio, $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$, is approximately constant. Through multiwavelength analysis, we instead find that the X-ray-weaker mBHs in our sample tend toward larger values of $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ even though they remain radio-quiet per their optical$-$UV properties. This trend results in a tentative but highly intriguing correlation between $L_{\rm R}/L_{\rm X}$ and X-ray weakness, which we argue is consistent with a scenario in which X-rays may be preferentially obscured from our line of sight by a ""slim"" accretion disk. We compare this observation to weak emission-line quasars (AGNs with exceptionally weak broad-line emission and a significant X-ray-weak fraction) and conclude by suggesting that our results may offer a new observational signature for finding high-accretion-rate AGNs.",{'black holes': 2},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Solving the $KP$ problem with the Global Cartan Decomposition,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02358v1,"Elija Perrier, Christopher S. Jackson","Geometric methods have useful application for solving problems in a range of quantum information disciplines, including the synthesis of time-optimal unitaries in quantum control. In particular, the use of Cartan decompositions to solve problems in optimal control, especially lambda systems, has given rise to a range of techniques for solving the so-called $KP$-problem, where target unitaries belong to a semi-simple Lie group manifold $G$ whose Lie algebra admits a $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}$ decomposition and time-optimal solutions are represented by subRiemannian geodesics synthesised via a distribution of generators in $\mathfrak{p}$. In this paper, we propose a new method utilising global Cartan decompositions $G=KAK$ of symmetric spaces $G/K$ for generating time-optimal unitaries for targets $-iX \in [\frak{p},\frak{p}] \subset \frak{k}$ with controls $-iH(t) \in \frak{p}$. Target unitaries are parametrised as $U=kac$ where $k,c \in K$ and $a = e^{iΘ}$ with $Θ\in \frak{a}$. We show that the assumption of $dΘ=0$ equates to the corresponding time-optimal unitary control problem being able to be solved analytically using variational techniques. We identify how such control problems correspond to the holonomies of a compact globally Riemannian symmetric space, where local translations are generated by $\mathfrak{p}$ and local rotations are generated by $[\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}]$.",{'geodesics': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Large curvature fluctuations from no-scale supergravity with a spectator field,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02295v1,Ioanna D. Stamou,"We investigate the large curvature perturbations which can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the context of no-scale supergravity. Our study does not depend on any exotic scenario, such as scalar potentials with inflection points or bulks, and aims to avoid the fine-tuning of model parameters to achieve the formation of PBHs. This formation relies on the quantum fluctuations of a light spectator stochastic field after the inflationary period. Our analysis is based on the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, considering both the inflaton and the spectator field. Specifically, we examine existing no-scale models with Starobinsky-like scalar potentials that are consistent with observable constraints on inflation from measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). These models involve two chiral fields: the inflaton and the modulus field. We propose a novel role for the modulus field as a spectator field, responsible for generating PBHs. Our hypothesis suggests that while the inflaton field satisfies the CMB constraints of inflation, it is the modulus field acting as the spectator that leads to large curvature perturbations, capable to explain the production of PBHs. Additionally, we prioritize retaining the inflationary constraints from the CMB through the consideration of spectator fluctuations. Therefore, by exploring the relationship between these fields within the framework of the SU(2,1)/SU(2)$\times$U(1) symmetry, our aim is to unveil their implications for the formation of PBHs.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']
Late time tail of waves on dynamic asymptotically flat spacetimes of odd space dimensions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02220v1,"Jonathan Luk, Sung-Jin Oh","We introduce a general method for understanding the late time tail for solutions to wave equations on asymptotically flat spacetimes with odd space dimensions. In particular, for a large class of equations, we prove that the precise late time tail is determined by the limits of higher radiation field at future null infinity.
  In the setting of stationary linear equations, we recover and generalize the Price law decay rates. In particular, in addition to reproving known results on $(3+1)$-dimensional black holes, this allows one to obtain the sharp decay rate for the wave equation on higher dimensional black hole spacetimes, which exhibits an anomalous rate due to subtle cancellations. More interesting, our method goes beyond the stationary linear case and applies to both equations on dynamical background and nonlinear equations. In this case, our results can be used to show that in general there is a correction to the Price law rates.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

Some years ago, Cunha et al. established a theorem stating that, under general assumptions, UCOs formed from smooth, quasi-Minkowski initial data, must have at least a pair of LRs, one of which must be stable. These stable LRs are supposed to trigger a non-linear instability in spacetime, potentially weakening UCOs' ability to replicate black hole phenomenology. However, this LR theorem does not extend to wormholes, which represent topologically nontrivial spacetimes. We address the wormhole case by proving the following theorem: a stationary, axisymmetric, asymptotically flat, traversable wormhole in 1+3 dimensions, connecting two different asymptotic regions, has at least one standard LR for each rotation sense. Thus, any (such) wormhole is an UCO. By filling this gap, our results not only broaden the horizon of knowledge on UCOs but also highlight their potential to closely mimic black hole phenomenology.",{'traversable wormhole': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

For intensive observables that are sums of local operators, because of their polynomially vanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm, weak eigenstate thermalization occurs in quadratic and integrable interacting systems. Here, we unveil a novel weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models whose single-particle sector exhibits quantum chaos (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we show that there are few-body observables with a nonvanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm that are guarrantied to exhibit a polynomially vanishing variance of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. For quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians, we prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the 3D Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ and XXZ models.",{'quantum chaos': 2},04.2024,2024,04,[]

Here we focus on an individual object, GS9422, a galaxy at $z_{\rm spec}=5.943$ with exquisite data from the JADES and JEMS surveys, including 14-band JWST/NIRCam photometry and deep NIRSpec prism and grating spectroscopy. We map the continuum emission and nebular emission lines across the galaxy on 0.2-kpc scales. GS9422 has been claimed to have nebular-dominated continuum and an extreme stellar population with top-heavy initial mass function. We find clear evidence for different morphologies in the emission lines, the rest-UV and rest-optical continuum emission, demonstrating that the full continuum cannot be dominated by nebular emission. While multiple models reproduce the spectrum reasonably well, our preferred model with a type-2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) and local damped Ly-$α$ (DLA) clouds can explain both the spectrum and the wavelength-dependent morphology. The AGN powers the off-planar nebular emission, giving rise to the Balmer jump and the emission lines, including Ly-$α$, which therefore does not suffer DLA absorption. A central, young stellar component dominates the rest-UV emission and -- together with the DLA clouds -- leads to a spectral turn-over. A disc-like, older stellar component explains the flattened morphology in the rest-optical continuum. We conclude that GS9422 is consistent with being a normal galaxy with an obscured, type-2 AGN -- a simple scenario, without the need for exotic stellar populations.",{'black holes': 1},04.2024,2024,04,['Black Holes and GR']

We present global, 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of black holes on inclined orbits colliding with magnetically arrested thick AGN disks using a binary black hole spacetime with mass ratio $0.1$. We do this by implementing an approximate time-dependent binary black hole metric into the GRMHD code Athena++. The secondary enhances the unbound mass outflow rate 2-4 times above that provided by the disk in quasi-periodic outbursts, eventually merging into a more continuous outflow at larger distances. We present a simple analytic model that qualitatively agrees well with this result and can be used to extrapolate to unexplored regions of parameter space. We show self-consistently for the first time that spin-orbit coupling between the primary black hole spin and the binary orbital angular momentum causes the accretion disk and jet directions to precess significantly (by 60$^\circ$-80$^\circ$) on long time-scales (e.g., $\sim$ 20 times the binary orbital period). Because this effect may be the only way for thick AGN disks to consistently precess, it could provide strong evidence of a secondary black hole companion if observed in such a system. Besides this new phenomenology, the time-average properties of the disk and accretion rates onto the primary are only marginally altered by the presence of the secondary, consistent with our estimate for a perturbed thick disk.

Assuming the supergravity dual prediction to correctly capture strong-coupling results in field theory, the answer is bound to encode a complete low-temperature expansion of the Gibbons-Hawking gravitational on-shell action, valid well beyond the vicinity of supersymmetric black hole solutions. The formula recovers the long awaited Schwarzian contribution at low enough temperatures. The computed mass-gap matches the conjectured strong-coupling result obtained by Boruch, Heydeman, Iliesiu and Turiaci in supergravity.

We show that in confining theories, the surfaces can be merged in the bulk at the infrared tip of the geometry and are homologous to the boundary region. The timelike entanglement entropy receives its imaginary and real contributions from the timelike and the spacelike surfaces, respectively. Additionally, we demonstrate that in confining theories, there exists a critical length within which a connected non-trivial surface can exist, and the imaginary part of the timelike entanglement entropy is non-zero. Therefore, the timelike entanglement entropy exhibits unique behavior in confining theories, making it a probe of confinement and phase transitions.

The explicit expression for energy-stress tensor is also determined by performing holographic renormalisation on the Einstein Hilbert action. By studying the anomalies of the energy-stress tensor, we obtain the leading and subleading contribution to the central charge.

Y. Wong, Juan Calderón Bustillo","Pair-instability supernova (PISN) is thought to prevent the formation of black holes from stellar collapse within the approximate mass range $M\in [65,130]M_\odot$. However, such black holes may form through hierarchical formation channels, as the result of merging ""ancestor"" black holes, whose properties determine those of the ``child'' black hole, namely its mass, spin, and recoil velocity (or kick). Crucially, the child black hole will be expelled from its host environment if its ""birth kick"" exceeds the corresponding escape velocity, preventing it from undergoing further mergers. In this work, we exploit tight relations between the final kick and final spin of quasi-circular black-hole mergers to obtain posterior probability distributions for the hypothetical ancestral masses, spins and birth kicks of the component black holes of GW190521, assuming both quasi-circular (with generic spins) eccentric (aligned-spin) scenarios for the latter. With this, we evaluate the probability $p_{2g}$ that the GW190521 components formed from the merger of stellar-origin black holes, being retained by the host environment. For the primary component BH1, which falls squarely in the PISN mass gap, we find that such scenario is strongly suppressed if GW190521 happened in a Globular Cluster, unless GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors, characteristic of isolated black-hole binary formation scenarios. Similarly, for denser host environments (excluding AGNs), we only obtain probabilities $p_{2g} > 0.5$ if GW190521 was quasi-circular and BH1 had aligned-spin ancestors. If GW190521 was eccentric, we find maximal values $p_{2g}$ of only $p_{2g} \simeq 0.1$ which require ancestral mass ratios $q\geq 2$, untypical of isolated formation scenarios.

We define an interface entropy from holographic entanglement entropy. At zero temperature we construct several illustrative examples and observe that the $g$-theorem is always satisfied. These examples also reveal distinct features of the interface entropy that are intricately linked to the scalar potential profiles.

Stupendously Large Black Hole Coalescence and Hubble Tensions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19957v1,"Earl Patrick Bellinger, Jakob Stegmann, Tom Wagg","Local and distant measurements of the Hubble constant are in significant tension: local measurements of the Hubble constant appear to show a Universe that is significantly contracted when compared to distant measurements. From the point of view of an observer, a passing gravitational wave could cause the Universe to appear locally contracted and expanded in a quadrupolar pattern. The inspiral of a pair of stupendously large black holes (SLABs) with a chirp mass of $\sim10^{21}~\rm{M}_\odot$ may produce gravitational radiation with sufficiently large amplitude and wavelength to increase $H_0$ in one direction, and decrease it by the same amount in the other. These tensions would then oscillate with a period corresponding to half the orbital period of the binary. If such a gravitational wave were aligned with the plane of the Milky Way, most readily visible galaxies would appear closer than they actually are, thereby causing the apparent Hubble tension. Due to the long binary period, we would be in the same phase of the gravitational wave for the complete history of astronomical observation. The opposite tension would be visible in the orthogonal directions, thus giving the opportunity to falsify the existence of inspiraling SLAB binaries. As a corollary, the Hubble tension may place an upper limit on the maximum mass of inspiraling black holes in the Universe.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The generalized black-bounce (GBB) spacetime, as a unified treatment of distinct kinds of geometries in the framework of general relativity (e.g. regular BH and wormholes), has been extensively studied. Firstly, we derive to give the explicit forms of Lagrangian for a nonlinear electromagnetic field and potential for a non-canonical phantom field in the action of gravitational system corresponding to GBB solution. Secondly, this paper computes the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the stable circular orbit region for different types of celestial bodies in GBB spacetime. The research suggests that traversable wormholes may have two ISCOs or one ISCO depending on the throat's scale, whereas regular BH and extremal BH possess only one ISCO. Thirdly, quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been found to be a reliable tool for testing gravitational theories. Therefore, we compute the radial and azimuthal epicyclic angular frequencies of particles oscillating on stable circular orbits around various celestial bodies and compare them with the oscillation frequency properties of schwarzschild BH. Moreover, due to the limited amount of research on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) phenomenon and its generation mechanisms around particles near wormholes using observational data, this paper aims to study theoretical models that can simultaneously describe both BH and wormholes by fitting observational data. Using resonance models and associated frequency ratios, we are able to locate the resonances of different celestial bodies within the GBB spacetime.","{'black holes': 1, 'traversable wormholes': 1}",03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Magic-induced computational separation in entanglement theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19610v3,"Andi Gu, Salvatore F. E. Oliviero, Lorenzo Leone","Entanglement serves as a foundational pillar in quantum information theory, delineating the boundary between what is classical and what is quantum. The common assumption is that higher entanglement corresponds to a greater degree of `quantumness'. However, this folk belief is challenged by the fact that classically simulable operations, such as Clifford circuits, can create highly entangled states. The simulability of these states raises a question: what are the differences between `low-magic' entanglement, and `high-magic' entanglement? We answer this question in this work with a rigorous investigation into the role of magic in entanglement theory. We take an operational approach to understanding this relationship by studying tasks such as entanglement estimation, distillation and dilution. This approach reveals that magic has notable implications for entanglement. Specifically, we find an operational separation that divides Hilbert space into two distinct regimes: the entanglement-dominated (ED) phase and magic-dominated (MD) phase. Roughly speaking, ED states have entanglement that significantly surpasses their magic, while MD states have magic that dominates their entanglement. The competition between the two resources in these two phases induces a computational phase separation between them: there are {sample- and time-efficient} quantum algorithms for almost any entanglement task on ED states, while these tasks are {provably computationally intractable} in the MD phase. Our results find applications in diverse areas such as quantum error correction, many-body physics, and the study of quantum chaos, providing a unifying framework for understanding the behavior of quantum systems. We also offer theoretical explanations for previous numerical observations, highlighting the broad implications of the ED-MD distinction across various subfields of physics.","{'quantum chaos': 1, 'quantum information theory': 1}",03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Fast and faithful interpolation of numerical relativity surrogate waveforms using meshfree approximation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19162v1,"Lalit Pathak, Amit Reza, Anand S. Sengupta","Several theoretical waveform models have been developed over the years to capture the gravitational wave emission from the dynamical evolution of compact binary systems of neutron stars and black holes. As ground-based detectors improve their sensitivity at low frequencies, the real-time computation of these waveforms can become computationally expensive, exacerbating the steep cost of rapidly reconstructing source parameters using Bayesian methods. This paper describes an efficient numerical algorithm for generating high-fidelity interpolated compact binary waveforms at an arbitrary point in the signal manifold by leveraging computational linear algebra techniques such as singular value decomposition and meshfree approximation. The results are presented for the time-domain \texttt{NRHybSur3dq8} inspiral-merger-ringdown (IMR) waveform model that is fine tuned to numerical relativity simulations and parameterized by the two component-masses and two aligned spins. For demonstration, we target a specific region of the intrinsic parameter space inspired by the previously inferred parameters of the \texttt{GW200311\_115853} event -- a binary black hole system whose merger was recorded by the network of advanced-LIGO and Virgo detectors during the third observation run. We show that the meshfree interpolated waveforms can be evaluated in $\sim 2.3$ ms, which is about $\times 38$ faster than its brute-force (frequency-domain tapered) implementation in the \textsc{PyCBC} software package at a median accuracy of $\sim \mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$. The algorithm is computationally efficient and scales favourably with an increasing number of dimensions of the parameter space.

Quantum focusing conjecture in two-dimensional evaporating black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19136v1,"Akihiro Ishibashi, Yoshinori Matsuo, Akane Tanaka","We consider the quantum focusing conjecture (QFC) for two-dimensional evaporating black holes. The QFC is closely related to the behavior of the generalized entropy -- the sum of the area entropy for a given co-dimension two surface and the entanglement entropy for quantum fields outside the area. In the context of the black hole evaporation, the entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation is decreasing after the Page time, and therefore it is not obvious whether the QFC holds in the black hole evaporation process especially after the Page time. One of the present authors previously addressed this problem in a four-dimensional spherically symmetric dynamical black hole model and showed that the QFC is satisfied. However the background spacetime considered was approximated by the Vaidya metric, and quantum effects of matters in the semiclassical regime is not fully taken into consideration. It remains to be seen if the QFC in fact holds for exact solutions of the semiclassical Einstein equations. In this paper, we address this problem in a two-dimensional dynamical black hole of the Russo-Susskind-Thorlacius (RST) model, which allows us to solve the semiclassical equations of motion exactly. We first give a suitable definition of the quantum expansion in two-dimensions and then prove that the QFC is satisfied for evaporating black holes in the RST model with the island formation taken into account.","{'black holes': 2, 'einstein equations': 1, 'hawking radiation': 1}",03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Araujo, Dongha Kim, Junghan Lee, Siheon Park, Ju-Young Ryu, Daniel K. Park","Quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) represent a promising approach in quantum machine learning, paving new directions for both quantum and classical data analysis. This approach is particularly attractive due to the absence of the barren plateau problem, a fundamental challenge in training quantum neural networks (QNNs), and its feasibility. However, a limitation arises when applying QCNNs to classical data. The network architecture is most natural when the number of input qubits is a power of two, as this number is reduced by a factor of two in each pooling layer. The number of input qubits determines the dimensions (i.e. the number of features) of the input data that can be processed, restricting the applicability of QCNN algorithms to real-world data. To address this issue, we propose a QCNN architecture capable of handling arbitrary input data dimensions while optimizing the allocation of quantum resources such as ancillary qubits and quantum gates. This optimization is not only important for minimizing computational resources, but also essential in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, as the size of the quantum circuits that can be executed reliably is limited. Through numerical simulations, we benchmarked the classification performance of various QCNN architectures when handling arbitrary input data dimensions on the MNIST and Breast Cancer datasets. The results validate that the proposed QCNN architecture achieves excellent classification performance while utilizing a minimal resource overhead, providing an optimal solution when reliable quantum computation is constrained by noise and imperfections.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Our scheme treats the light-cones (i.e., subspace) of quantum models as features and then select relevant ones through training of the corresponding local quantum kernels. We numerically demonstrate its versatility for four different applications using toy tasks: (1) feature selection of classical inputs, (2) circuit architecture search for data embedding, (3) compression of quantum machine learning models and (4) subspace selection for quantum data.

In this paper, we calculate the strong/weak gravitational lensing effects under the quantum-corrected black hole model, taking the supermassive black holes M87* and SgrA* as the subjects of study to explore the impact of the quantum correction parameter $α$ on the positions of images and the Einstein ring. Our calculations show that in the case of strong gravitational lensing, the lensing coefficient $\bar{a}$ increases with an increase in the quantum correction parameter, while the deflection angle and the lensing coefficient $\bar{b}$ decrease with an increase in the quantum correction parameter. The quantum correction parameter $α$ has a significant impact in the context of supermassive black holes. In weak gravitational lensing, the quantum correction parameter $α$ plays a suppressive role. Our theoretical analysis suggests that with advancements in future astrophysical observation techniques, it might be possible to test loop quantum gravity theory using the gravitational lensing effect.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Innermost stable circular orbits around a spinning black hole binary,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.18533v1,"Eiki Kagohashi, Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa","Using the exact solution that describes multi-centered rotating black holes, recently discovered by Teo and Wan, we investigate the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for massive particles and the circular orbit for massless particles moving around a spinning black hole binary. We assume equal masses $M_1 = M_2=m$ and equal spin angular momenta $|J_1| = |J_2|$ for both black holes. Firstly, we examine the case where two black holes are spinning in the same direction ($J_1=J_2$). We clarify that that for particles rotating in the same direction as (opposite directions to) black holes' spin, the greater the spin angular momenta of the black holes, the more the radii of the ISCO for massive particles and the circular orbit for massless particles decrease (increase). We show that distinct ISCO transitions occur for particles rotating in the same direction as the black holes in three ranges of spin angular momenta: $0<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2< 0.395...$, $0.395...<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2< 0.483...$, and $0.483...<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2<0.5$. Conversely, particles rotating in the opposite direction to the black holes exhibit a consistent transition pattern for the case $0<J_1/m^2=J_2/m^2<0.5$. Secondly, we study the situation where binary black holes are spinning in opposite directions ($J_1=-J_2$). We clarify that for large (small) separations between black holes, the ISCO appears near the black hole that is spinning in the same (opposite) direction as particles' rotation. Additionally, we show that different ISCO transitions occur in the three angular momentum ranges: $0<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2< 0.160...$, $0.160...<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2< 0.467...$, and $0.467...<J_1/m^2=-J_2/m^2<0.5$.",{'black holes': 9},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

By considering two different expansion forms of the density matrices adopted in the biorthogonal and right-state time evolutions, we have derived two versions of the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equations describing the non-Hermitian systems coupled to a bosonic heat bath in thermal equilibrium. By solving the equations, we have identified a sufficient condition for thermalization under both time evolutions, resulting in Boltzmann biorthogonal and right-eigenstate statistics, respectively.

For accreting neutron stars, the speed of their compact jets can reveal whether the jets are powered by magnetic fields anchored in the accretion flow or in the star itself, but to-date no such measurements exist. These objects can display bright explosions on their surface due to unstable thermonuclear burning of recently accreted material, called type-I X-ray bursts, during which the mass accretion rate increases. Here, we report on bright flares in the jet emission for a few minutes after each X-ray burst, attributed to the increased accretion rate. With these flares, we measure the speed of a neutron star compact jet to be $v=0.38^{+0.11}_{-0.08}$c, much slower than those from black holes at similar luminosities. This discovery provides a powerful new tool in which we can determine the role that individual system properties have on the jet speed, revealing the dominant jet launching mechanism.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

However, it is known that the EFT of gravity can break down at a lower scale, the species scale $Λ_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, if there are light species of particles. Here we point out that there is a third scale $Λ_{\rm BH}\lesssim Λ_s\lesssim M_{\rm pl}$, which marks the inverse length (or the temperature) of the smallest black hole where the EFT gives a correct description of its entropy and free energy. This latter scale is hard to detect from the viewpoint of EFT as it represents a phase transition to a state with lower free energy. We illustrate this using examples drawn from consistent QG landscape. In particular $Λ_{\rm BH}$ gets related to Gregory--Laflamme transition in the decompactification limits of quantum gravity and to the Horowitz--Polchinski solution in the light perturbative string limits. We propose the existence of $Λ_{\rm BH}$ marking the temperature at which neutral black holes undergo a phase transition, as a new Swampland condition for all consistent quantum theories of gravity.

To date observational estimates of massive black hole spins are scarce, and the assumptions commonly made in such estimates have been recently questioned. Similarly, theoretical models for massive black hole spin evolution, while reproducing the few observational constraints, are based on possibly oversimplified assumptions. New independent constraints on massive black hole spins are therefore of primary importance. We present a rigorous statistical analysis of the relative orientation of radio jets and mega-maser discs in ten low-redshift galaxies. We find a strong preference for (partial) alignment between jets and mega-masers, that can be attributed to two different causes: ""coherent"" and ""selective"" accretion. In the first case the partial alignment is due to an anisotropy in the gas reservoir fueling the growth of MBHs. In the second case the spin-dependent anisotropic feedback allows for long-lived accretion only if the orbits of the gas inflows are almost aligned to the MBH equatorial plane. A discussion of the implications of the two accretion scenarios on the evolution of MBHs is presented, together with an outlook on future observational tests aiming at discriminating between the two scenarios and at checking if any of the two apply to different redshifts and black hole mass regimes.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Emergent Anomalous Hydrodynamics at Infinite Temperature in a Long-Range XXZ Model,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17912v1,"Ang Yang, Jinlou Ma, Lei Ying","The conventional wisdom suggests that transports of conserved quantities in non-integrable quantum many-body systems at high temperatures are diffusive. However, we discover a counterexample of this paradigm by uncovering anomalous hydrodynamics in a spin-1/2 XXZ chain with power-law couplings. This model, classified as non-integrable due to its Wigner-Dyson level-spacing statistics in the random matrix theory, exhibits a surprising superdiffusive-ballistic-superdiffusive transport transition by varying the power-law exponent of couplings for a fixed anisotropy. Our findings are verified by multiple observables, including the spin-spin autocorrelator, mean-square displacement, and spin conductivity. Interestingly, we further quantify the degree of quantum chaos using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the entanglement entropy distributions of the model's eigenstates and a random state. Remarkably, an observed local maximum in the divergence near the transition boundary suggests a link between anomalous hydrodynamics and a suppression of quantum chaos.

Galaxy groups as the ultimate probe of AGN feedback,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17145v1,"Dominique Eckert, Fabio Gastaldello, Ewan O'Sullivan, Alexis Finoguenov, Marisa Brienza, the X-GAP collaboration","The co-evolution between supermassive black holes and their environment is most directly traced by the hot atmospheres of dark matter halos. Cooling of the hot atmosphere supplies the central regions with fresh gas, igniting active galactic nuclei (AGN) with long duty cycles. Outflows from the central engine tightly couple with the surrounding gaseous medium and provide the dominant heating source preventing runaway cooling. Every major modern hydrodynamical simulation suite now includes a prescription for AGN feedback to reproduce realistic populations of galaxies. However, the mechanisms governing the feeding/feedback cycle between the central black holes and their surrounding galaxies and halos are still poorly understood. Galaxy groups are uniquely suited to constrain the mechanisms governing the cooling-heating balance, as the energy supplied by the central AGN can exceed the gravitational binding energy of halo gas particles. Here we provide a brief overview of our knowledge of the impact of AGN on the hot atmospheres of galaxy groups, with a specific focus on the thermodynamic profiles of groups. We then present our on-going efforts to improve on the implementation of AGN feedback in galaxy evolution models by providing precise benchmarks on the properties of galaxy groups. We introduce the \XMM~ Group AGN Project (X-GAP), a large program on \XMM~ targeting a sample of 49 galaxy groups out to $R_{500c}$.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Dual AGNs: Precursors of Binary Supermassive Black Hole Formation and Mergers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17076v1,"Vida Saeedzadeh, Arif Babul, Suvodip Mukherjee, Michael Tremmel, Thomas R. Quinn, Lucio Mayer","The presence of dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) on scales of a few tens of kpc can be used to study merger-induced accretion on supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and offer insights about SMBH mergers, using dual AGNs as merger precursors. In this study, we use the Romulus25 cosmological simulation to investigate the properties and evolution of dual AGNs. We first analyze the properties of AGNs ($L_{bol} > 10^{43} \rm erg/s$) and their neighboring SMBHs (any SMBHs closer than 30 pkpc to an AGN) at $z \leq 2$. This is our underlying population. Subsequently, we applied the luminosity threshold of $L_{bol} > 10^{43} erg/s$ to the neighboring SMBHs thereby identifying dual and multiple AGNs in our simulation. We examined the properties and statistics of dual AGNs in comparison to single AGNs. Our findings indicate an increase in the number of both single and dual AGNs from lower to higher redshifts. All dual AGNs in our sample resulted from major mergers. Compared with the single AGN population, duals are characterized by a lower black hole to halo mass ratio. We found that the properties of dual AGN host halos, including halo mass, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas mass, are generally consistent with those of single AGN halos, albeit tending towards the higher end of their respective property ranges. Our analysis uncovered a diverse array of evolutionary patterns among dual AGNs, including rapidly evolving systems, slower ones, and instances where SMBH mergers are ineffective.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

We find that these Euclidean wormholes set natural initial conditions for inflation and that the semi-classical Wheeler-DeWitt wavefunction can favor a long lasting inflationary epoch, resolving a well known issue of the no-boundary proposal. Due to the asymptotic $AdS$ conditions in the Euclidean past they raise the possibility of describing the physics of inflating cosmologies and their perturbations within the context of holography.",{'holography': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']
Geometric Thermodynamics of Collapse of Gels,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16991v1,"Asif Raza, Sanhita Das, Debasish Roy","Stimulus-induced volumetric phase transition in gels may be potentially exploited for various bio-engineering and mechanical engineering applications. Since the discovery of the phenomenon in the 1970s, extensive experimental research has helped in understanding the phase transition and related critical phenomena. Yet, little insight is available on the evolving microstructure. In this article, we aim at unravelling certain geometric aspects of the micromechanics underlying discontinuous phase transition in polyacrylamide gels. Towards this, we use geometric thermodynamics and a Landau-Ginzburg type free energy functional involving a squared gradient, in conjunction with Flory-Huggins theory. We specifically exploit Ruppeiner's approach of Riemannian geometry-enriched thermodynamic fluctuation theory that has been previously employed to investigate phase transitions in van der Waals fluids and black holes. The framework equips us with a scalar curvature that relates to the microstructural interactions of a gel during phase transition and at critical points.

Limits on Dark Matter Compact Objects implied by Supermagnified Stars in Lensing Clusters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16989v1,"Claudi Vall Müller, Jordi Miralda-Escudé","Supermagnified stars are gravitationally lensed individual stars that are located close to a caustic of a lensing galaxy cluster, and have their flux magnified by a large enough factor (typically ~ 1000) to make them detectable with present telescopes. The maximum magnification is limited by microlensing caused by intracluster stars or other compact objects, which create a network of corrugated critical lines with an angular width proportional to the surface density of microlenses. We consider a set of 9 cases of supermagnified stars reported in the literature, and derive an upper limit on the surface density of compact objects, such as primordial black holes, that might be present as a fraction of the dark matter in addition to known intracluster stars. Any such additional compact objects would widen the corrugated critical line network and therefore the width of the distribution of supermagnified stars around the modeled critical lines of the lens. We find that any compact objects, including primordial black holes, with masses above $\sim 10^{-6}\, M_{\odot}$ (for which the microcaustics are smaller than the typical angular size of supermagnified stars) cannot account for more than ~ 3% of the dark matter.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Sriramkumar","Over the last few years, primordial black holes (PBHs) have emerged as a strong candidate for cold dark matter. A significant number of PBHs are produced when the strength of the primordial scalar power spectrum is enhanced on small scales (compared to the COBE normalized values on large scales). Such primordial spectra also inevitably lead to strong amplification of the scalar-induced, secondary gravitational waves (GWs) at higher frequencies. The recent detection of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) by the pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) has opened up the possibility of directly probing the very early universe. Different studies have shown that, when PBHs are assumed to have been formed during the epoch of radiation domination, the mechanism for the amplification of the scalar-induced GWs that is required to explain the PTA data can overproduce the PBHs over some ranges of masses. In this work, we assume a specific functional form for the primordial scalar power spectrum and examine the production of PBHs and the scalar-induced secondary GWs during the phase of reheating, which precedes the standard epoch of radiation domination. Specifically, we account for the uncertainties in the conditions for the formation of PBHs and ensure that the extent of PBHs produced remains within the observational bounds. We find that the scalar-induced SGWB generated during a phase of reheating with a steeper equation of state (than that of radiation) fit the NANOGrav 15-year data with a stronger Bayesian evidence than the astrophysical scenario involving GWs produced by merging supermassive binary black holes.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

However, the measurement of SFF in many-body systems is challenging due to the difficulty in resolving level spacings that become exponentially small with increasing system size. Here we experimentally measure the SFF to probe the presence or absence of chaos in quantum many-body systems using a superconducting quantum processor with a randomized measurement protocol. For a Floquet chaotic system, we observe signatures of spectral rigidity of random matrix theory in SFF given by the ramp-plateau behavior. For a Hamiltonian system, we utilize SFF to distinguish the quantum many-body chaotic phase and the prethermal many-body localization. We observe the dip-ramp-plateau behavior of random matrix theory in the chaotic phase, and contrast the scaling of the plateau time in system size between the many-body chaotic and localized phases. Furthermore, we probe the eigenstate statistics by measuring a generalization of the SFF, known as the partial SFF, and observe distinct behaviors in the purities of the reduced density matrix in the two phases.

Although various attempts to quantify and characterize the nature of quantum computational advantage have been made, this question in the general context remains open: There is no universal approach that helps to define a scope of problems that quantum computers are able to speed up, theoretically and in practice. Here we review an approach to this question based on the concept of complexity and reachability of quantum states. On the one hand, the class of quantum states that is of interest for quantum computing should be complex, i.e. non-simulatable with classical computers with less than exponential resources. On the other hand, such quantum states should be reachable on a practical quantum computer. This means that a unitary corresponding to the transformation of quantum states from initial to desired can be decomposed in a sequence of single- and two-qubit gates with of no more than polynomial in the number of qubits.

High-Temperature Gibbs States are Unentangled and Efficiently Preparable,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16850v1,"Ainesh Bakshi, Allen Liu, Ankur Moitra, Ewin Tang","We show that thermal states of local Hamiltonians are separable above a constant temperature.

This sudden death of thermal entanglement upends conventional wisdom about the presence of short-range quantum correlations in Gibbs states.
  Moreover, we show that we can efficiently sample from the distribution over product states. In particular, for any $β< 1/( c \mathfrak{d}^3)$, we can prepare a state $ε$-close to $ρ$ in trace distance with a depth-one quantum circuit and $\textrm{poly}(n) \log(1/ε)$ classical overhead.

Viti, N. Harada, T. Díaz-Santos, J. S. Gallagher","How galaxies regulate nuclear growth through gas accretion by supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is one of the most fundamental questions in galaxy evolution. One potential way to regulate nuclear growth is through a galactic wind that removes gas from the nucleus. It is unclear whether galactic winds are powered by jets, mechanical winds, radiation, or via magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes. Compact obscured nuclei (CONs) represent a significant phase of galactic nuclear growth. These galaxies hide growing SMBHs or unusual starbursts in their very opaque, extremely compact (r $<$ 100 pc) centres. They are found in approximately 30 % of the luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG and ULIRG) population. Here, we present high-resolution ALMA observations ($\sim$30 mas, $\sim$5 pc) of ground-state and vibrationally excited HCN towards ESO 320-G030 (IRAS 11506-3851). ESO 320-G030 is an isolated luminous infrared galaxy known to host a compact obscured nucleus and a kiloparsec-scale molecular wind. Our analysis of these high-resolution observations excludes the possibility of a starburst-driven wind, a mechanically or energy driven active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind, and exposes a molecular MDH wind. These results imply that the nuclear evolution of galaxies and the growth of SMBHs are similar to the growth of hot cores or protostars where gravitational collapse of the nuclear torus drives a MHD wind. These results mean galaxies are capable, in part, of regulating the evolution of their nuclei without feedback.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

As a result, we improved the accuracy by two orders of magnitude over existing methods using matrix product states. Our approach, characterized by a shallow quantum circuit primarily comprising nearest-neighbor qubit gates and linear scalability with qubit count, is highly advantageous for noisy quantum devices.

We benchmark the method on the finite-temperature equilibrium Green's function in the noninteracting limit against exact solutions and in the single-orbital Anderson impurity model against GTEMPO calculations.

We can regard both the changes of photon sphere radius and impact parameter before and after phase transition as the order parameter; their critical exponents near the critical point are equal to the same value 1/2, just like ordinary thermal systems.

This is a fundamental feature in first passage percolation (FPP) models where nearby geodesics naturally coalesce in search of the easiest passage through the landscape. Road designers seek the same in pursuing cost savings, hence FPP geodesics are straightforward candidates to model road layouts. Unfortunately no detailed knowledge is rigorously available on FPP geodesics. To address this, we use exponential LPP instead to build a stochastic model of road traffic and prove certain characteristics thereof. Cars start from every point of the lattice and follow half-infinite geodesics in random directions. Exponential LPP is known to be in the KPZ universality class and it is widely expected that FPP shares very similar properties, hence our findings should equally apply to FPP-based modelling.

We argue that realistic telescope arrays similar in area to existing Cherenkov arrays, if equipped with modern high-precision single photon detectors, can achieve a sufficiently high signal to noise ratio not only to detect distant AGN, but also to study them in great detail. We explore the science potential of such observations by considering two examples. First, we find that intensity interferometric observations of bright nearby AGN can allow detailed studies of the central accretion disks powering the AGN, allowing reconstruction of many disk properties like the radial profile. Next, we argue that intensity interferometers can spatially resolve the broad-line regions of AGN at cosmological distances, and thereby provide a geometric determination of the angular diameter distances to those AGN when combined with reverberation mapping. Since this measurement can be performed for AGN at distances of hundreds of megaparsecs, this directly measures the Hubble expansion rate $H_0$, with a precision adequate to resolve the recent Hubble tension.

For nearly extremal black holes the absorption probability for the challenging modes turns out to be of the order $ε^5$, where $ε$ parametrizes the closeness to extremality. This value implies that the event horizon is preserved without the need to employ the backreaction effects. The result directly follows from the incorporation of the absorption probabilities into the analysis. We also review and extend our previous comments on Sorce-Wald method. We show that the order magnitude problems can be avoided by abandoning the non-physical parameter $λ$. The conditions derived by Sorce-Wald can be legitimately used to incorporate the back-reaction effects by avoiding to multiply them by $λ^2$, thereby preserving the magnitude of their contribution.

Other scalar-tensor models do not have this problem when time-dependence of the scalar provides a natural matching to cosmology. Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet is particularly rigid and such a scenario does not help. An extra operator makes the theory behave like the other models and the cosmological horizon can be accommodated.

Gravitational Wave Sourced by Decay of Massive Particle from Primordial Black Hole evaporation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15269v1,"Ki-Young Choi, Erdenebulgan Lkhagvadorj, Satyabrata Mahapatra","In this article, we investigate the stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) spectrum, resulting from the emission of gravitons through bremsstrahlung, in the decay of particles produced by Hawking radiation. Although particle decays inevitably entail the emission of graviton due to bremsstrahlung, the associated decay width is notably suppressed due to the Planck scale suppression in the coupling of matter fields to gravitons. Consequently, the relic abundance of such GWs constituted of these gravitons undergoes a corresponding reduction. However, we demonstrate that super-heavy particles, reaching masses as high as Planck scale, can emerge naturally in the Hawking radiation of evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) and can compensate for this suppression. In addition, we also discuss the stochastic gravitational waves constituted out of the gravitons directly radiated from such evaporating PBHs. When the super-heavy particle decays promptly after its production, then the corresponding GW spectrum remains subdominant to the one arising from direct PBH evaporation. However, if this particle is long-lived and decays after PBH evaporation, then the resulting GWs produced in these two processes have two distinct spectra with their peaks at extremely high frequencies, providing avenues for proposed ultra-high frequency gravitational wave detectors. We also show that such gravitational waves contribute significantly to substantial dark radiation, well within the anticipated sensitivity thresholds of future experiments like CMB-S4 and EUCLID.","{'black holes': 1, 'hawking radiation': 2}",03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Thus, we have considered a more physical scenario, where the effects of thermal fluctuations are also considered as a source of a traversable wormhole. To obtain a dependence on such a thermal Casimir effect, consider the plates positioned at a distance either parametrically fixed or radially varying. In both cases, the temperature effects are investigated. We demonstrate that thermal fluctuations modify the throat of the wormhole.

Based on dark matter halo merger trees spanning the redshift range from $z=20$ to $z=4$, it now incorporates essential components such as gas heating and cooling, cold and hot BH accretion, jet and radiative AGN feedback. We show how different BH growth models impact quasar and galaxy observables at $z \geq 5$, providing predictions that will help discriminate between super-Eddington and Eddington-limited accretion models: despite being both consistent with observed properties of SMBHs and their host galaxies at $z \sim 5-7$, they become very clearly distinguishable at higher redshift and in the intermediate mass regime. We find that the super-Eddington model, unlike the Eddington-limited scenario, predicts a gap in the BH mass function corresponding to the intermediate-mass range $10^4 \mathrm{M_\odot} < M_\mathrm{bh} < 10^6 \mathrm{M_\odot}$. Additionally, it predicts black holes up to two orders of magnitude more massive for the same stellar mass at $z=9$. The resulting velocity dispersion - BH mass relation at $z \geq 5$ is consistent with local measurements, suggesting that its slope and normalisation are independent of redshift. Depending on the Eddington ratio, we also model the emergence of AGN jets, predicting their duty cycle across as a function of BH mass and their potential impact on the observed number density distribution of high-redshift AGN in the hard X-ray band.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Entanglement wedge reconstruction implies an extension of static patch holography where the exterior region connecting the static patches is included, and reconstructible from the two screens. A phase transition occurs where there is an exchange of dominance between two competing quantum extremal surfaces, leading to a transfer of the encoding of the exterior region from one screen to the other.

Kraft","While supermassive black holes (BHs) are widely observed in the nearby and distant universe, their origin remains debated with two viable formation scenarios with light and heavy seeds. In the light seeding model, the first BHs form from the collapse of massive stars with masses of $10-100 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, while the heavy seeding model posits the formation of $10^{4-5} \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ seeds from direct collapse. The detection of BHs at redshifts $z\gtrsim10$, edging closer to their formation epoch, provides critical observational discrimination between these scenarios. Here, we focus on the JWST-detected galaxy, GHZ 9, at $z\approx10$ that is lensed by the foreground cluster, Abell 2744. Based on 2.1 Ms deep Chandra observations, we detect a candidate X-ray AGN, which is spatially coincident with the high-redshift galaxy, GHZ 9. The BH candidate is inferred to have a bolometric luminosity of $(1.0^{+0.5}_{-0.4})\times10^{46} \ \rm{erg \ s^{-1}}$, which corresponds to a BH mass of $(8.0^{+3.7}_{-3.2})\times10^7 \ \rm{M_{\odot}}$ assuming Eddington-limited accretion.

To this end, we find a small/large black hole phase transition in all dimensions of space-time, the existence of a conventional critical point implies a total topological charge of $Q_t=-1$. The coupling constant $α$ gives rise to a more intricate phase structure, with the emergence of a triple points requires $α\geq0.5$ and $d=6$. Interestingly, the condition for the occurrence of small/intermediate/large phase transition is that the coupling constant a takes a special value ($α=0.5$), the two conventional critical points $CP_{1},CP_{2}$ of the black hole are physical critical point, and the novel critical point $CP_{3}$ that lacks the capability to minimize the Gibbs free energy. The critical points $CP_{1}$ and $CP_{2}$ are observed to occur at the maximum extreme points of temperature in the isobaric curve, while the critical point $CP_{3}$, emerges at the minimum extreme points of temperature. Furthermore, the number of phases at the novel critical point exhibits an upward trend, followed by a subsequent decline at the conventional critical points. With the increase of the coupling constant ($α= 1$), although the system has three critical points, only the conventional $CP_{1}$ is a (physical) critical point, and the conventional $CP_{2}$ serves as the phase annihilation point. This means that the coupling constant $α$ has a non-negligible effect on the phase structure.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

A trade off was observed between the number of time steps in the descent/ascent and the number of GRAPE iterations ran on the optimisation for low C-shunt factors $0<ζ<1000$.

Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand, the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold"" black hole state of the quantum BTZ black hole.

The properties of FR0 radio galaxies as intermediate objects in the evolution of radio galaxies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14153v1,"David Garofalo, Chandra B. Singh, Eddie Harmon, Michael Williams, Luis Rojas Castillo","The counter-rotation between black holes and accretion disk configuration was introduced over a decade ago to elucidate the nature of the radio loud/radio-quiet dichotomy and the jet-disk connection, but has since been applied to a plethora of observations across space and time. We briefly review the paradigm in which counter-rotation is key for the triggering of radio galaxies and its observational support, then apply it to a series of observations concerning FR0 radio galaxies. FR0 radio galaxies appear to be radio galaxies in transition, with low-spinning black holes and thus weaker but tilted jets with respect to an earlier radio quasar phase. As a result, FR0 radio galaxies are prescribed to be in an earlier phase of star formation suppression in radio galaxies, compared to a later phase that is unlikely to be less than tens of millions of years in the future if they have enough accretion fuel to evolve into more powerful FRI radio galaxies. FR0 radio galaxies will have a greater or lesser star formation suppression feedback effect depending on how long they live. Tilted jets also enhance stellar velocities in the bulge. Because FR0 jet lengths are of the same order of magnitude as the radius of the stellar bulge, FR0 jets are prescribed to have begun, more or less recently depending on their age, to affect stellar velocity dispersions as well. As a result, they will be associated with dispersion values that tend to be larger than for characteristically non-jetted active galaxies, but smaller than giant radio galaxies such as M87 that have experienced a long-term tilted and more powerful FRI jet.

We then prove that quantum circuits under any non-unital noise exhibit lack of barren plateaus for cost functions composed of local observables. But, by leveraging the effective shallowness, we also design a classical algorithm to estimate Pauli expectation values within inverse-polynomial additive error with high probability over the ensemble. Its runtime is independent of circuit depth and it operates in polynomial time in the number of qubits for one-dimensional architectures and quasi-polynomial time for higher-dimensional ones. Taken together, our results showcase that, unless we carefully engineer the circuits to take advantage of the noise, it is unlikely that noisy quantum circuits are preferable over shallow quantum circuits for algorithms that output Pauli expectation value estimates, like many variational quantum machine learning proposals.

We find that when $p$ is greater than a transition value $p_1$, which scales as $1/N^3$, both the SFF and $r$ match the values attained by the full unsparsified model and with expectations from random matrix theory (RMT). But for $p<p_1$, deviations from unsparsified SYK and RMT occur, indicating a breakdown of holography in the highly sparsified regime. Below an even smaller value $p_2$, which also scales as $1/N^3$, even the spacing of consecutive eigenvalues differs from RMT values, signaling a complete breakdown of spectral rigidity. Our results cast doubt on the holographic interpretation of very highly sparsified SYK models obtained via machine learning using teleportation infidelity as a loss function.",{'holography': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']
Heavy States in 3d Gravity and 2d CFT,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13757v1,David Grabovsky,"We discuss correlators of light fields in heavy states in 3d gravity and holographic 2d CFTs. In the bulk, the propagator of free fields in AdS backgrounds containing a conical defect or a BTZ black hole can be obtained by solving the wave equation, as well as by the method of images. On the boundary, these geometries are sourced by heavy operator insertions, and the propagator is dual to a heavy-light (HHLL) correlator. By matching its expansion in Virasoro blocks to our bulk results, we determine the OPE coefficients of all contributing states in both the s and t channels. In the s channel, these states are excitations of the light field on top of the heavy state, and their OPE coefficients are the amplitudes to create them. The t-channel OPE is dominated by the Virasoro vacuum block, but there is also an infinite family of light two-particle states that contribute to the correlator. The OPE coefficients that couple these states to heavy operators represent their expectation values in heavy backgrounds. We determine them exactly, derive their asymptotic form at large twist, and discuss their behavior near and above the BTZ threshold, where they become thermal one-point functions.",{'BTZ black hole': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']
Experimental fault-tolerant code switching,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13732v1,"Ivan Pogorelov, Friederike Butt, Lukas Postler, Christian D. Marciniak, Philipp Schindler, Markus Müller, Thomas Monz","Quantum error correction is a crucial tool for mitigating hardware errors in quantum computers by encoding logical information into multiple physical qubits. However, no single error-correcting code allows for an intrinsically fault-tolerant implementation of all the gates needed for universal quantum computing [1-3]. One way to tackle this problem is to switch between two suitable error-correcting codes, while preserving the encoded logical information, which in combination give access to a fault-tolerant universal gate set [4-6]. In this work, we present the first experimental implementation of fault-tolerant code switching between two codes. One is the seven-qubit color code [7], which features fault-tolerant CNOT and $H$ quantum gates, while the other one, the 10-qubit code [8], allows for a fault-tolerant $T$-gate implementation. Together they form a complementary universal gate set. Building on essential code switching building blocks, we construct logical circuits and prepare 12 different logical states which are not accessible natively in a fault-tolerant way within a single code. Finally, we use code switching to entangle two logical qubits employing the full universal gate set in a single logical quantum circuit. Our results experimentally open up a new route towards deterministic control over logical qubits with low auxiliary qubit overhead, not relying on the probabilistic preparation of resource states.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Scalability of quantum error mitigation techniques: from utility to advantage,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13542v1,"Sergey N. Filippov, Sabrina Maniscalco, Guillermo García-Pérez","Error mitigation has elevated quantum computing to the scale of hundreds of qubits and tens of layers; however, yet larger scales (deeper circuits) are needed to fully exploit the potential of quantum computing to solve practical problems otherwise intractable. Here we demonstrate three key results that pave the way for the leap from quantum utility to quantum advantage: (1) we present a thorough derivation of random and systematic errors associated to the most advanced error mitigation strategies, including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), zero noise extrapolation (ZNE) with probabilistic error amplification, and tensor-network error mitigation (TEM); (2) we prove that TEM (i) has the lowest sampling overhead among all three techniques under realistic noise, (ii) is optimal, in the sense that it saturates the universal lower cost bound for error mitigation, and (iii) is therefore the most promising approach to quantum advantage; (3) we propose a concrete notion of practical quantum advantage in terms of the universality of algorithms, stemming from the commercial need for a problem-independent quantum simulation device. We also establish a connection between error mitigation, relying on additional measurements, and error correction, relying on additional qubits, by demonstrating that TEM with a sufficient bond dimension works similarly to an error correcting code of distance 3. We foresee that the interplay and trade-off between the two resources will be the key to a smooth transition between error mitigation and error correction, and hence between near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers. Meanwhile, we argue that quantum computing with optimal error mitigation, relying on modest classical computer power for tensor network contraction, has the potential to reach larger scales in accurate simulation than classical methods alone.",{'tensor network': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Tensor Networks']

To date, no experiments have successfully demonstrated a quantum advantage due to the ease with which the results can be adequately replicated on classical computers through the use of tensor network algorithms. Additionally, it remains unclear even in theory where exactly these advantages are rooted within quantum systems because the logarithmic complexity commonly associated with quantum algorithms is also present in algorithms based on tensor networks. In this article, we propose a novel approach called Tensor Quantum Programming, which leverages tensor networks for hybrid quantum computing. Our key insight is that the primary challenge of algorithms based on tensor networks lies in their high ranks (bond dimensions). Quantum computing offers a potential solution to this challenge, as an ideal quantum computer can represent tensors with arbitrarily high ranks in contrast to classical counterparts, which indicates the way towards quantum advantage. While tensor-based vector-encoding and state-readout are known procedures, the matrix-encoding required for performing matrix-vector multiplications directly on quantum devices remained unsolved. Here, we developed an algorithm that encodes Matrix Product Operators into quantum circuits with a depth that depends linearly on the number of qubits. It demonstrates effectiveness on up to 50 qubits for several matrices frequently encountered in differential equations, optimization problems, and quantum chemistry. We view this work as an initial stride towards the creation of genuinely practical quantum algorithms.","{'quantum computer': 1, 'tensor network': 1, 'tensor networks': 3}",03.2024,2024,03,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

This eliminates the need for phase stepping and multiple acquisitions, thereby greatly reducing total measurement time for imaging with long acquisition times at low flux or enabling video-rate imaging at higher flux. With this single-frame acquisition technique, we are able to reconstruct transmission images of an object in the infrared beam with a signal-to-noise ratio of $1.78\,\pm\,0.06$ at 10 frames per second, and record a dynamic scene in the infrared beam at 33 frames per second.",{'holography': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']

The metric is constructed as a boosted Kerr-Schild superposition following post-Newtonian (PN) trajectories at the fourth PN order in the inspiral phase. During merger, we interpolate the binary metric in time to a single black hole remnant with properties obtained from numerical relativity (NR) fittings. Different from previous approaches, the new metric can model binary black holes with arbitrary spin direction, mass ratio, and eccentricity at any stage of their evolution in a fast and computationally efficient way. We analyze the properties of our new metric and we compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution. We show that Hamiltonian constraints are well-behaved even at merger and that the mass and spin of the black holes deviate in average only $\sim 5 \%$ compared to the full numerical evolution. We perform a General Relativistic magneto-hydrodynamical (GRMHD) simulation of uniform gas evolving on top of our approximate metric. We compare it with a full numerical relativity evolution of the fluid and Einstein's equations. We show that the properties of the gas such as the accretion rate are remarkably similar between the two approaches, exhibiting only $\sim 10 \%$ differences in average. The approximate metric is five times more efficient among other computational advantages. The numerical implementation of the metric is now open-source and optimized for numerical work.

There are two techniques for circuit transformation. The first is a rule-based approach that greedily cancels out pairs of gates that equate to the identity unitary operation. Rule-based approaches are used in quantum compilers such as Qiskit, tket, and Quilc. The second is a search-based approach that tries to find an equivalent quantum circuit by exploring the quantum circuits search space. Search-based approaches typically rely on machine learning techniques such as generative models and Reinforcement Learning (RL).

We carry out cosmological simulations of a volume of 16 cMpc3 and zoom-ins of a galaxy group and of a galaxy cluster. The advantages of our new technique are assessed in comparison to commonly adopted methods to hamper spurious BH displacements, i.e. repositioning onto a local minimum of the gravitational potential and ad-hoc boosting of the BH particle dynamical mass. The newly-introduced dynamical friction correction provides centering of BHs on host halos which is at least comparable with the other techniques. It predicts half as many merger events with respect to the repositioning prescription, with the advantage of being less prone to leave sub-structures without any central BH. Simulations featuring our dynamical friction prescription produce a smaller (by up to 50% with respect to repositioning) population of wandering BHs and final BH masses in good agreement with observations. As for individual BH-BH interactions, our dynamical friction model captures the gradual inspiraling of orbits before the merger occurs. By contrast, the repositioning scheme, in its most classical renditions considered, describes extremely fast mergers, while the dynamical mass misrepresents the BHs' dynamics, introducing numerical scattering between the orbiting BHs. Given its performances in describing the centering of BHs within host galaxies and the orbiting of BH pair before their merging, our dynamical friction correction opens interesting applications for an accurate description of the evolution of BH demography within cosmological simulations of galaxy formation at different cosmic epochs and within different environments.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

For small distances we reproduce the constant correlators of a strongly-coupled conformal field theory, while for large distances the effects of confinement dominate and the correlators decay exponentially. We find exact shockwave solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of the IR brane, hence avoiding the need for a perturbative expansion in terms of Witten diagrams. While some of the expected qualitative features of energy correlators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are reproduced, our crude model of confinement does not capture the effects of asymptotic freedom nor exhibit jetty behavior.

Enhancing Digital Hologram Reconstruction Using Reverse-Attention Loss for Untrained Physics-Driven Deep Learning Models with Uncertain Distance,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12056v1,"Xiwen Chen, Hao Wang, Zhao Zhang, Zhenmin Li, Huayu Li, Tong Ye, Abolfazl Razi","Untrained Physics-based Deep Learning (DL) methods for digital holography have gained significant attention due to their benefits, such as not requiring an annotated training dataset, and providing interpretability since utilizing the governing laws of hologram formation. However, they are sensitive to the hard-to-obtain precise object distance from the imaging plane, posing the $\textit{Autofocusing}$ challenge. Conventional solutions involve reconstructing image stacks for different potential distances and applying focus metrics to select the best results, which apparently is computationally inefficient. In contrast, recently developed DL-based methods treat it as a supervised task, which again needs annotated data and lacks generalizability. To address this issue, we propose $\textit{reverse-attention loss}$, a weighted sum of losses for all possible candidates with learnable weights. This is a pioneering approach to addressing the Autofocusing challenge in untrained deep-learning methods. Both theoretical analysis and experiments demonstrate its superiority in efficiency and accuracy. Interestingly, our method presents a significant reconstruction performance over rival methods (i.e. alternating descent-like optimization, non-weighted loss integration, and random distance assignment) and even is almost equal to that achieved with a precisely known object distance.

Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance as a success metric for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11995v1,"Leo Joon Il Moon, Mandar M. Sohoni, Michael A. Shimizu, Praveen Viswanathan, Kevin Zhang, Eun-Ah Kim, Peter L. McMahon","The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for quantum simulation that can be run on near-term quantum hardware. A challenge in VQE -- as well as any other heuristic algorithm for finding ground states of Hamiltonians -- is to know how close the algorithm's output solution is to the true ground state, when the true ground state and ground-state energy are unknown. This is especially important in iterative algorithms, such as VQE, where one wants to avoid erroneous early termination. Recent developments in Hamiltonian reconstruction -- the inference of a Hamiltonian given an eigenstate -- give a metric can be used to assess the quality of a variational solution to a Hamiltonian-eigensolving problem. This metric can assess the proximity of the variational solution to the ground state without any knowledge of the true ground state or ground-state energy. In numerical simulations and in demonstrations on a cloud-based trapped-ion quantum computer, we show that for examples of both one-dimensional transverse-field-Ising (11 qubits) and two-dimensional J1-J2 transverse-field-Ising (6 qubits) spin problems, the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance gives a helpful indication of whether VQE has yet found the ground state or not. Our experiments included cases where the energy plateaus as a function of the VQE iteration, which could have resulted in erroneous early stopping of the VQE algorithm, but where the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance correctly suggests to continue iterating. We find that the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance has a useful correlation with the fidelity between the VQE solution and the true ground state. Our work suggests that the Hamiltonian-reconstruction distance may be a useful tool for assessing success in VQE, including on noisy quantum processors in practice.",{'quantum computer': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Thermal Tensor Network Approach for Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Quantum Magnets,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11895v2,"Ning Xi, Yuan Gao, Chengchen Li, Shuang Liang, Rong Yu, Xiaoqun Wang, Wei Li","Low-dimensional quantum magnets, particularly those with strong spin frustration, are characterized by their notable spin fluctuations. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) serves as a sensitive probe of low-energy fluctuations that offers valuable insight into rich magnetic phases and emergent phenomena in quantum magnets. Although experimentally accessible, the numerical simulation of NMR relaxation rates, specifically the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$, remains a significant challenge. Analytical continuation based on Monte Carlo calculations are hampered by the notorious negative sign for frustrated systems, and the real-time simulations incur significant costs to capture low-energy fluctuations. Here we propose computing the relaxation rate using thermal tensor networks (TTNs), which provides a streamlined approach by calculating its imaginary-time proxy. We showcase the accuracy and versatility of our methodology by applying it to one-dimensional spin chains and two-dimensional lattices, where we find that the critical exponents $η$ and $zν$ can be extracted from the low-temperature scalings of the simulated $1/T_1$ near quantum critical points. Our results also provide insights into the low-dimensional and frustrated magnetic materials, elucidating universal scaling behaviors in the Ising chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and revealing the renormalized classical behaviors in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_8$CoNb$_6$O$_{24}$. We apply the approach to effective model of the family of frustrated magnets AYbCh$_2$ (A = Na, K, Cs, and Ch = O, S, Se), and find dramatic changes from spin ordered to the proposed quantum spin liquid phase.

The majority of research in this area has focused on developing methods capable of producing highly accurate, point-estimate, predictions for the GW signal. A key element missing from every model used in the analysis of GW data is an estimate for how confident the model is in its prediction. This omission increases the risk of biased parameter estimation of source properties. Current strategies include running analyses with multiple models to measure systematic bias however, this fails to accurately reflect the true uncertainty in the models. In this work we develop a probabilistic extension to the phenomenological modelling workflow for non-spinning black holes and demonstrate that the model not only produces accurate point-estimates for the GW signal but can be used to provide well-calibrated local estimates for its uncertainty. Our analysis highlights that there is a lack of Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations available at multiple resolutions which can be used to estimate their numerical error and implore the NR community to continue to improve their estimates for the error in NR solutions published. Waveform models that are not only accurate in their point-estimate predictions but also in their error estimates are a potential way to mitigate bias in GW parameter estimation of compact binaries due to unconfident waveform model extrapolations.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

In the absence of higher derivative corrections, it is known that the Coulomb repulsion prevents a test particle that would break the extremal condition from falling into an extremal black hole and therefore the black hole cannot be destroyed. We extend this observation to include higher derivative corrections. Although the extremal condition is modified by the higher derivative interactions, we find that the repulsive force induced by the higher derivative couplings is responsible for preventing a test particle that would break the modified extremal condition to reach the event horizon. Thus, we confirm that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture holds for extremally charged black holes even in the presence of higher derivative corrections, as long as the test particle approximation is justified.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The redshift evolution of primordial black hole merger rate,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11325v1,Viktor Stasenko,"The gravitational wave signals detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration can be explained by mergers of binary primordial black holes (PBHs) formed in the radiation dominated epoch. However, in early structures induced by the Poisson distribution of PBHs, a significant fraction of binaries are perturbed and avoid mergers. In addition, the internal dynamics of early halos lead to the formation of dense primordial black hole clusters within a few Hubble times from the moment of halo formation. In such clusters PBH binaries are effectively formed and their mergers potentially dominate in the modern era. We obtained that the PBH merger rate changes with redshift as $\mathcal{R} \propto (1 + z)^β$, where $β= 1.4 - 2.2$ reflects the influence of PBH clustering and depends on both $z$ and $f_{\rm PBH}$.

Procedurally Optimised ZX-Diagram Cutting for Efficient T-Decomposition in Classical Simulation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10964v1,"Matthew Sutcliffe, Aleks Kissinger","A quantum circuit may be strongly classically simulated with the aid of ZX-calculus by decomposing its $t$ T-gates into a sum of $2^{αt}$ classically computable stabiliser terms. In this paper, we introduce a general procedure to find an optimal pattern of vertex cuts in a ZX-diagram to maximise its T-count reduction at the cost of the fewest cuts. Rather than reducing a Clifford+T diagram based on a fixed routine of decomposing its T-gates directly (as is the conventional approach), we focus instead on taking advantage of certain patterns and structures common to such circuits to, in effect, design by automatic procedure an arrangement of spider decompositions that is optimised for the particular circuit. In short, this works by assigning weights to vertices based on how many T-like gates they are blocking from fusing/cancelling and then appropriately propagating these weights through any neighbours which are then blocking weighted vertices from fusing, and so on. Ultimately, this then provides a set of weightings on relevant nodes, which can then each be cut, starting from the highest weighted down. While this is a heuristic approach, we show that, for circuits small enough to verify, this method achieves the most optimal set of cuts possible $71\%$ of the time. Furthermore, there is no upper bound for the efficiency achieved by this method, allowing, in principle, an effective decomposition efficiency $α\rightarrow0$ for highly structured circuits. Even applied to random pseudo-structured circuits (produced from CNOTs, phase gates, and Toffolis), we record the number of stabiliser terms required to reduce all T-gates, via our method as compared to that of the more conventional T-decomposition approaches (with $α\approx0.47$), and show consistent improvements of orders of magnitude, with an effective efficiency $0.1\lesssimα\lesssim0.2$.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

By constructing constrained RMT ensembles that account for two local scalar charges playing the role of energy and magnetization, we describe the patterns of entanglement of mid-spectrum eigenstates at all lengthscales and beyond their average behavior, analytically and numerically. When defining the correspondence between quantum chaos and RMT, our work clarifies that RMT ensembles must be constrained to account for all the features of the underlying Hamiltonian, particularly spatial locality and symmetries.",{'quantum chaos': 2},03.2024,2024,03,[]
Studying Stabilizer de Finetti Theorems and Possible Applications in Quantum Information Processing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10592v1,Paula Belzig,"Symmetries are of fundamental interest in many areas of science. In quantum information theory, if a quantum state is invariant under permutations of its subsystems, it is a well-known and widely used result that its marginal can be approximated by a mixture of tensor powers of a state on a single subsystem. Applications of this quantum de Finetti theorem range from quantum key distribution (QKD) to quantum state tomography and numerical separability tests. Recently, it has been discovered by Gross, Nezami and Walter that a similar observation can be made for a larger symmetry group than permutations: states that are invariant under stochastic orthogonal symmetry are approximated by tensor powers of stabilizer states, with an exponentially smaller overhead than previously possible. This naturally raises the question if similar improvements could be found for applications where this symmetry appears (or can be enforced). Here, two such examples are investigated.",{'quantum information theory': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The operator faithfully reproduces two fundamental features of quantum skyrmions: their classical magnetic order and a ""quantum cloud"" of local spin-flip excitations. Using exact numerical simulations of the ground states of a 2D chiral magnetic model, we find two regions in the single-skyrmion state diagram distinguished by their leading quantum corrections. We use matrix product state simulations of the adiabatic braiding of two skyrmions to verify that the operator representation of skyrmions is valid at large inter-skyrmion distances. Our work demonstrates that skyrmions can be approximately coarse-grained and represented by bosonic quasiparticles, which paves the way toward a field theory of many-skyrmion quantum phases and, unlike other approaches, incorporates the microscopic quantum fluctuations of individual skyrmions.",{'matrix product state': 1},03.2024,2024,03,[]
Optimizing post-Newtonian parameters and fixing the BMS frame for numerical-relativity waveform hybridizations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10278v1,"Dongze Sun, Michael Boyle, Keefe Mitman, Mark A. Scheel, Leo C. Stein, Saul A. Teukolsky, Vijay Varma","Numerical relativity (NR) simulations of binary black holes provide precise waveforms, but are typically too computationally expensive to produce waveforms with enough orbits to cover the whole frequency band of gravitational-wave observatories. Accordingly, it is important to be able to hybridize NR waveforms with analytic, post-Newtonian (PN) waveforms, which are accurate during the early inspiral phase. We show that to build such hybrids, it is crucial to both fix the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) frame of the NR waveforms to match that of PN theory, and optimize over the PN parameters. We test such a hybridization procedure including all spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes with $|m|\leq \ell$ for $\ell\leq 8$, using 29 NR waveforms with mass ratios $q\leq 10$ and spin magnitudes $|χ_1|, |χ_2|\leq 0.8$. We find that for spin-aligned systems, the PN and NR waveforms agree very well. The difference is limited by the small nonzero orbital eccentricity of the NR waveforms, or equivalently by the lack of eccentric terms in the PN waveforms. To maintain full accuracy of the simulations, the matching window for spin-aligned systems should be at least 5 orbits long and end at least 15 orbits before merger. For precessing systems, the errors are larger than for spin-aligned cases. The errors are likely limited by the absence of precession-related spin-spin PN terms. Using $10^5\,M$ long NR waveforms, we find that there is no optimal choice of the matching window within this time span, because the hybridization result for precessing cases is always better if using earlier or longer matching windows. We provide the mean orbital frequency of the smallest acceptable matching window as a function of the target error between the PN and NR waveforms and the black hole spins.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Analytical perturbations of relativistic images in Kerr space-time,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10169v2,"Fabio Aratore, Valerio Bozza","Light rays passing very close to black holes may wind several times before escaping. For any given electromagnetic source around the black hole, a distant observer would thus observe two infinite sequences of images on either side of the black hole. These images are generated by light rays performing an increasing numbers of loops. The strong deflection limit provides a simple analytic formalism to describe such higher order images for spherically symmetric metrics, while for axially symmetric black holes one typically resorts to numerical approaches. Here we present the leading order perturbation to higher order images when the black hole spin is turned on. We show that the images slide around the black hole shadow as an effect of space-time dragging. We derive analytical formulae for their shifts and the perturbation of their time delays. We also discuss how such simple analytical formulae for images by Kerr black holes can be of great help in many applications.",{'black holes': 3},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

We achieve this by a many-body semiclassics analysis, appropriate for the mesoscopic regime of large but finite number of particles. We then identify the universality of both the cross-correlations and the Gaussian distribution of expansion coefficients as the signatures of chaotic eigenstates. Combined, these two aspects imprint a distinctive backbone to the morphology of eigenstates that we check against extensive quantum simulations. The universality of eigenstate correlations for fixed energy density is then a further signature of many-body quantum chaos that, while consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, lies beyond random matrix theory.",{'quantum chaos': 1},03.2024,2024,03,[]

Despite this, there are no systematic studies of exact force-free fields in an expanding universe. In this paper, we use geometric methods to find a wide variety of force-free solutions in a fixed Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric background.

Particular attention is given to a family of exactly solvable models whose ground states admit a matrix product state description and generalize the AKLT chain. We call these models ``$SO(n)$ AKLT chains'' and the phase they occupy the ``$SO(n)$ Haldane phase''. We present new results describing their ground state structure and, when $n$ is even, their peculiar $O(n)$-to-$SO(n)$ symmetry breaking. We also prove that these states have arbitrarily large correlation and injectivity length by increasing $n$, but all have a 2-local parent Hamiltonian, in contrast to the natural expectation that the interaction range of a parent Hamiltonian should diverge as these quantities diverge. We extend Ogata's definition of an SPT index for a split state for a finite symmetry group $G$ to an SPT index for a compact Lie group $G$. We then compute this index, which takes values in the second Borel group cohomology $H^2(SO(n),U(1))$, at a single point in each of the SPT phases. The two points have different indices, confirming the two SPT phases are indeed distinct.

Cutting a Wire with Non-Maximally Entangled States,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09690v2,"Marvin Bechtold, Johanna Barzen, Frank Leymann, Alexander Mandl","Distributed quantum computing supports combining the computational power of multiple quantum devices to overcome the limitations of individual devices. Circuit cutting techniques enable the distribution of quantum computations via classical communication. These techniques involve partitioning a quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits, each containing fewer qubits. The original circuit's outcome can be replicated by executing these subcircuits on separate devices and combining their results. However, the number of circuit executions required to achieve a fixed result accuracy with circuit cutting grows exponentially with the number of cuts, posing significant costs. In contrast, quantum teleportation allows the distribution of quantum computations without an exponential increase in circuit executions. Nevertheless, each teleportation requires a pre-shared pair of maximally entangled qubits for transmitting a quantum state, and non-maximally entangled qubits cannot be used for this purpose. Addressing this, our work explores utilizing non-maximally entangled qubit pairs in wire cutting, a specific form of circuit cutting, to mitigate the associated costs. The cost of this cutting procedure reduces with the increasing degree of entanglement in the pre-shared qubit pairs. We derive the optimal sampling overhead in this context and present a wire cutting technique employing pure non-maximally entangled states that achieves this optimal sampling overhead. Hence, this offers a continuum between existing wire cutting and quantum teleportation.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

This emerging capability of quantum computers confers numerous advantages that can enable more efficient and powerful protocols by drastically reducing the resource requirements for certain core algorithmic primitives. In particular, in the case of the $n$-qubit quantum Fourier transform followed immediately by measurement, the scaling of resource requirements is reduced from $O(n^2)$ two-qubit gates in an all-to-all connectivity in the standard unitary formulation to $O(n)$ mid-circuit measurements in its dynamic counterpart without any connectivity constraints.

High-energy Neutrinos from Outflows Powered by Kicked Remnants of Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN Accretion Disks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09387v1,"Zhi-Peng Ma, Kai Wang","Merging of stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) could take place within the accretion disk of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The resulting BH remnant is likely to accrete the disk gas at a super-Eddington rate, launching a fast, quasi-spherical outflow (wind). Particles will be accelerated by shocks driven by the wind, subsequently interacting with the shocked disk gas or radiation field through hadronic processes and resulting in the production of high-energy neutrinos and potential electromagnetic (EM) emissions. This study delves into the intricate evolution of the shock driven by the remnant BH wind within AGN disks. Subsequently, we calculated the production of neutrinos and the expected detection numbers for a single event, along with their contributions to the overall diffuse neutrino background. Our analysis, considering various scenarios, reveals considerable neutrino production and possible detection by IceCube for nearby events. The contribution of the remnant BH winds on the diffuse neutrino background is minor due to the low event rate density, but it can be improved to some extent for some optimistic parameters. We also propose that there could be two neutrino/EM bursts, one originating from the premerger BBH wind and the other from the remnant BH wind, with the latter typically having a time gap to the GW event of around tens of days. When combined with the anticipated gravitational waves (GW) emitted during the BBH merger, such a system emerges as a promising candidate for joint observations involving neutrinos, GWs, and EM signals.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

However, an open question is whether QMBS exists in higher-dimensional LGTs with dynamical matter. Given that nonergodic dynamics in $d{=}1$ spatial dimension tend to vanish in $d{>}1$, it is important to probe this question. Using matrix product state techniques for both finite and infinite systems, we show that QMBS occurs in the $2{+}1$D $\mathrm{U}(1)$ quantum link model (QLM), as evidenced in persistent coherent oscillations in local observables, a marked slowdown in the growth of the bipartite entanglement entropy, and revivals in the fidelity. Interestingly, we see that QMBS is more robust when the matter degrees of freedom are bosonic rather than fermionic.

The impact of unresolved binary systems on mass estimation is rigorously assessed, adopting three mass ratio profiles for correction. The PDMF is characterized by the power-law index, $α$, derived through a robust maximum likelihood method that avoids biases associated with data binning. The value of $α$ for stars between the completeness limited mass of Gaia with a mean 0.3 $M_\odot$ for our cluster samples and 2 $M_\odot$, exhibits stability for clusters younger than 200 Myr, decreasing for older clusters, particularly when considering stars within the half-mass radius. The PDMF of these star clusters is consistent with a dynamically evolved Kroupa IMF via the loss of low-mass stars. Cluster morphology shows a correlation with $α$, as $α$ values exhibit a decreasing trend from filamentary to tidal-tail clusters, mirroring the sequence of increasing cluster age. The dependence of $α$ on total cluster mass is weak, with a subtle increase for higher-mass clusters, especially outside the half-mass radius. We do not observe a correlation between $α$ and the mean metallicity of the clusters. Younger clusters have lower metallicity compared to their older counterparts, which indicates that the older clusters might have migrated to the solar neighbourhood from the inner disk.

Effect of Earth&#39;s Oblateness on Black Hole Imaging Through Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08606v1,"Aditya Tamar, Ben Hudson, Daniel Palumbo","Earth-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth's finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. Herein, this paper investigates the effect of Earth's oblateness, also known as the $J_{2}$ effect, on orbiters in Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the $J_{2}$ effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to the mission's advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in existing space-VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the $J_{2}$ effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we have demonstrated how the $J_{2}$ effect leads to modest increase in shorter baseline coverage, filling gaps in the $(u,v)$ plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the $J_{2}$ effect on the $(u,v)$ plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing $(u,v)$ coverage using the $J_{2}$ affected and invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and SgrA* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long term orbital stability on longer baselines.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in symmetric random circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08459v1,"Shuo Liu, Hao-Kai Zhang, Shuai Yin, Shi-Xin Zhang","Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1) symmetric circuits for certain small symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively.

Observational tests in scale invariance II: gravitational lensing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.08379v1,"Andre Maeder, Frederic Courbin","We study the path of light rays passing near a massive object, in the context of the scale invariant equation of the geodesics first obtained by Dirac (1973). Using the exterior Schwarzschild solution for the metric, we derive the complete equations of the geodesics in the scale invariant context. We find that scale invariance introduces two additional terms to the Einstein term producing the deflection angle and that can potentially act over cosmological distances. Numerical integration of the scale-invariant geodesics, for the specific case of the z_L=1.94 lens galaxy in the extreme system JWST-ER1 (van Dokkum et al. 2023) shows that the two additional terms introduce only negligible effects, typically 1E-06 of the Einstein term. We conclude that the lensing deflection angle derived in Einstein's General Relativity is essentially independent of the scale invariant effects and that the photon's geodesics remain unchanged. We also explore the possible origin of the differences in the mass estimates from lensing and photometry in JWST-ER1 and in the SLACS galaxies, differences which appear larger at higher redshifts.",{'geodesics': 4},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

The black hole solutions are asymptotic to the AdS$_D$ geometry and can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the gauged supergravities on the compact internal manifolds, leading to the restriction as $4\leq D\leq 7$. By studying the behavior of the generalized free energy under the change of the ensemble temperature, we determine the thermodynamic phases and the corresponding phase transitions of black holes. This is confirmed by investigating the heat capacity at the constant pressure and the on-shell free energy. In the canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes can be classified into three different classes as follows: (i) $D=4$, (ii) $D=5$, and (iii) $D=6,7$. Whereas, in the grand canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes is independent of the number of spacetime dimensions and the pressure, but depends on the chemical potential $Φ$.

Galaxy mergers may be an important route to fuel and to produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs can be observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to systematically search for such dual quasars at previously unreachable sub-kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. Here we present the first detailed study of a 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation, VODKA-selected dual quasar, J0749+2255, at $z=2.17$ using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. This is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars identified today. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, best traced by the narrow \ha\ emission. Line ratio diagnostics show a mix of ionization from the two quasars and intense star formation. The spatially-resolved spectra of the two quasars suggest that they have very similar black hole properties (two $M_{BH}\sim 10^9\ \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ with large Eddington ratio reaching $L/L_{Edd}\sim0.2$) hinting at the possible synchronized growth and accretion from the same gas supply. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest an extended, rotating disk rather than a disturbed system that would be expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. While it is unclear if J0749+2255 is representative of the dual quasar evolution, the observations with JWST revealed a major puzzle.

In particular, we establish two conceptually distinct perspectives on `electron correlation' leading to a notion of orbital and particle correlation. We then demonstrate that particle correlation equals total orbital correlation minimized over all orbital bases. Accordingly, particle correlation resembles the minimal, thus intrinsic, complexity of many-electron wave functions while orbital correlation quantifies their complexity relative to a basis. We illustrate these concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic correlation complexity in molecular systems, which also manifests the crucial link between the two correlation pictures. Our results provide theoretical justification for the long-favored natural orbitals for simplifying electronic structures, and open new pathways for developing more efficient approaches towards the electron correlation problem.",{'quantum information theory': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Here we conduct a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of the triaxial Schwarzschild method at $\textit{simultaneously}$ determining $M_{BH}$, stellar mass-to-light ratio $M^{*}/L$, dark matter mass, and three intrinsic triaxial shape parameters of simulated galaxies. For each of 25 rounds of mock observations using simulated stellar kinematics and the $\texttt{TriOS}$ code, we derive best-fitting parameters and confidence intervals after a full search in the 6D parameter space with our likelihood-based model inference scheme.

The spatially varying velocity anisotropy of the stellar orbits is also well recovered.

Using Equation of State Constraints to Classify Low-Mass Compact Binary Mergers,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07697v1,"Jacob Golomb, Isaac Legred, Katerina Chatziioannou, Adrian Abac, Tim Dietrich","Compact objects observed via gravitational waves are classified as black holes or neutron stars primarily based on their inferred mass with respect to stellar evolution expectations. However, astrophysical expectations for the lowest mass range, $\lesssim 1.2 \,M_\odot$, are uncertain. If such low-mass compact objects exist, ground-based gravitational wave detectors may observe them in binary mergers. Lacking astrophysical expectations for classifying such observations, we go beyond the mass and explore the role of tidal effects. We evaluate how combined mass and tidal inference can inform whether each binary component is a black hole or a neutron star based on consistency with the supranuclear-density equation of state. Low-mass neutron stars experience a large tidal deformation; its observational identification (or lack thereof) can therefore aid in determining the nature of the binary components. Using simulated data, we find that the presence of a sub-solar mass neutron star (black hole) can be established with odds $\sim 100:1$ when two neutron stars (black holes) merge and emit gravitational waves at signal-to-noise ratio $\sim 20$. For the same systems, the absence of a black hole (neutron star) can be established with odds $\sim 10:1$. For mixed neutron star-black hole binaries, we can establish that the system contains a neutron star with odds $\gtrsim 5:1$. Establishing the presence of a black hole in mixed neutron star-black hole binaries is more challenging, except for the case of a $\lesssim 1\,M_{\odot}$ black hole with a $\gtrsim 1\,M_{\odot}$ neutron star companion.

Observations of compact binary coalescences enable us to test GR in extreme environments of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, large spacetime curvature, and velocities comparable to the speed of light.

We study in detail the holographic description of such states at $Q>2$, by considering the contribution to the energies of $Q$ scalar particles coming from single photon and graviton exchange in the bulk of AdS; in some cases, scalar exchange and bulk contact terms are also included. For a range of finite values of $Q$ and $J$, we numerically diagonalize the Hamiltonian for such states and examine the resulting spectrum and wavefunctions as a function of the dimension $Δ$ of the charge-one operator and the central charges $c_{\mathcal{T}}, c_{\mathcal{J}}$ of the stress tensor and U(1) current, finding multiple regions in parameter space with qualitatively different behavior. We discuss the extension of these results to the regime of parametrically large charge $Q$, as well as to what extent such results are expected to hold universally, beyond the limit of holographic CFTs.

Massive clusters, which represent the densest structures in the Universe, provide an excellent laboratory to isolate environmental effects and study their impact on black hole growth. In this work, we critically review observational evidence for the preferential activation of SMBHs in the outskirts of galaxy clusters. We develop a semi-empirical model under the assumption that the incidence of AGN in galaxies is independent of environment. We demonstrate that the model is broadly consistent with recent observations on the AGN halo occupation at $z=0.2$, although it may overpredict satellite AGN in massive halos at that low redshift. We then use this model to interpret the projected radial distribution of X-ray sources around high redshift ($z\approx1$) massive ($>5 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$) clusters, which show excess counts outside their virial radius. Such an excess naturally arises in our model as a result of sample variance. Up to 20% of the simulated projected radial distributions show excess counts similar to the observations, which are however, because of background/foreground AGN and hence, not physically associated with the cluster.

Moreover, removing entanglement from a quantum model often results in as good or better performance, suggesting that ""quantumness"" may not be the crucial ingredient for the small learning tasks considered here.

Investigating model dependencies for obscured Active Galactic Nuclei: a case study of NGC 3982,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06972v1,"Kristína Kallová, Peter G. Boorman, Claudio Ricci","X-ray spectroscopy of heavily obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) offers a unique opportunity to study the circum-nuclear environment of accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs). However, individual models describing the obscurer have unique parameter spaces that give distinct parameter posterior distributions when fit to the same data. To assess the impact of model-specific parameter dependencies, we present a case study of the nearby heavily obscured low-luminosity AGN NGC 3982, which has a variety of column density estimations reported in the literature. We fit the same broadband XMM-Newton + NuSTAR spectra of the source with five unique obscuration models and generate posterior parameter distributions for each. By using global parameter exploration, we traverse the full prior-defined parameter space to accurately reproduce complex posterior shapes and inter-parameter degeneracies. The unique model posteriors for the line-of-sight column density are broadly consistent, predicting Compton-thick $N_{\rm H}$ $>1.5\times10^{24}\rm cm^{-2}$ at the 3$σ$ confidence level. The posterior median intrinsic X-ray luminosity in the 2-10 keV band however was found to differ substantially, with values in the range log $L_{ 2-10\,{\rm keV}}$ergs$^{-1}$ = 40.9-42.1 for the individual models. We additionally show that the posterior distributions for each model occupy unique regions of their respective multi-dimensional parameters spaces, and how such differences can propagate into the inferred properties of the central engine. We conclude by showcasing the improvement in parameter inference attainable with the High Energy X-ray Probe (HEX-P) with a uniquely broad simultaneous and high-sensitivity bandpass of 0.2-80 keV.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Fully non-Gaussian Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06962v1,"Gabriele Perna, Chiara Testini, Angelo Ricciardone, Sabino Matarrese","Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves (SIGWs) represent a particular class of primordial signals which are sourced at second-order in perturbation theory whenever a scalar fluctuation of the metric is present. They form a guaranteed Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) that, depending on the amplification of primordial scalar fluctuations, can be detected by GW detectors. The amplitude and the frequency shape of the scalar-induced SGWB can be influenced by the statistical properties of the scalar density perturbations. In this work we study the intuitive physics behind SIGWs and we analyze the imprints of local non-Gaussianity of the primordial curvature perturbation on the GW spectrum. We consider all the relevant non-Gaussian contributions up to fifth-order in the scalar seeds without any hierarchy, and we derive the related GW energy density $Ω_{\rm GW}(f)$. We perform a Fisher matrix analysis to understand to which accuracy non-Gaussianity can be constrained with the LISA detector, which will be sensitive in the milli-Hertz frequency band. We find that LISA, neglecting the impact of astrophysical foregrounds, will be able to measure the amplitude, the width and the peak of the spectrum with an accuracy up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$, while non-Gaussianity can be measured up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$.

Exploring Unique Quasinormal Modes of a Massive Scalar Field in Brane-World Scenarios,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06867v1,Antonina F. Zinhailo,"We compute precise values of quasinormal modes of a massive scalar field in the background of the Schwarzschild-like brane-localised black holes. It is shown that the quasinormal spectrum of the massive field differs qualitatively from that previously known for other black hole models, due to the presence of two kinds of modes: those whose damping rate vanishes as the mass of the field $μ$ increases up to some critical value, and those whose real oscillation frequency vanishes at a certain value of $μ$. While the first type of modes, which are arbitrarily long-lived, are recognized in various four-dimensional backgrounds as quasi-resonances, the second type is a novel feature for asymptotically flat black holes. When $Re (ω)$ reaches zero, the fundamental mode disappears from the spectrum and the first overtone becomes the fundamental mode. We also demonstrate that quasi-resonances may not exist for brane-localised black holes immersed in $D\geq 6$ - dimensional bulk.",{'black holes': 3},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Bignone","The variations in metallicity and spatial patterns within star-forming regions of galaxies result from diverse physical processes unfolding throughout their evolutionary history, with a particular emphasis in recent events. Analysing MaNGA and \textsc{eagle} galaxies, we discovered an additional dependence of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) on metallicity gradients ($\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$). Two regimes emerged for low and high stellar mass galaxies, distinctly separated at approximately ${\rm M_{\star}} >10^{9.75}$.
  Low-mass galaxies with strong positive $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$ appear less enriched than the MZR median, while those with strong negative gradients are consistently more enriched in both simulated and observed samples. Interestingly, low-mass galaxies with strong negative $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$ exhibit high star-forming activity, regardless of stellar surface density or $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$. In contrast, a discrepancy arises for massive galaxies between MaNGA and \textsc{eagle} datasets. The latter exhibit a notable anticorrelation between specific star formation rate and stellar surface density, independent of $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$, while MaNGA galaxies show this trend mainly for strong positive $\nabla_{\rm (O/H)}$. Further investigation indicates that galaxies with strong negative gradients tend to host smaller central black holes in observed datasets, a trend not replicated in simulations. These findings suggest disparities in metallicity recycling and mixing history between observations and simulations, particularly in massive galaxies with varying metallicity gradients.

Fast classical simulation of quantum circuits via parametric rewriting in the ZX-calculus,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06777v1,"Matthew Sutcliffe, Aleks Kissinger","The ZX-calculus is an algebraic formalism that allows quantum computations to be simplified via a small number of simple graphical rewrite rules. Recently, it was shown that, when combined with a family of ""sum-over-Cliffords"" techniques, the ZX-calculus provides a powerful tool for classical simulation of quantum circuits. However, for several important classical simulation tasks, such as computing the probabilities associated with many measurement outcomes of a single quantum circuit, this technique results in reductions over many very similar diagrams, where much of the same computational work is repeated. In this paper, we show that the majority of this work can be shared across branches, by developing reduction strategies that can be run parametrically on diagrams with boolean free parameters. As parameters only need to be fixed after the bulk of the simplification work is already done, we show that it is possible to perform the final stage of classical simulation quickly utilising a high degree of GPU parallelism.

Differential geometry and general relativity with algebraifolds,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06548v1,Tobias Fritz,"It is often noted that many of the basic concepts of differential geometry, such as the definition of connection, are purely algebraic in nature. Here, we review and extend existing work on fully algebraic formulations of differential geometry which eliminate the need for an underlying manifold. While the literature contains various independent approaches to this, we focus on one particular approach that we argue to be the most natural one based on the definition of \emph{algebraifold}, by which we mean a commutative algebra $\mathcal{A}$ for which the module of derivations of $\mathcal{A}$ is finitely generated projective. Over $\mathbb{R}$ as the base ring, this class of algebras includes the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions on a manifold $M$, and similarly for analytic functions. An importantly different example is the Colombeau algebra of generalized functions on $M$, which makes distributional differential geometry an instance of our formalism. Another instance is a fibred version of smooth differential geometry, since any smooth submersion $M \to N$ makes $C^\infty(M)$ into an algebraifold with $C^\infty(N)$ as the base ring.Over any field $k$ of characteristic zero, examples include the algebra of regular functions on a smooth affine variety as well as any function field.

Evidence of a Past Merger of the Galactic Center Black Hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06416v2,"Yihan Wang, Bing Zhang","The origin of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing in the centers of most galaxies remains a mystery. Various growth models, such as accretion and hierarchical mergers, have been proposed to explain the existence and cosmological evolution of these SMBHs, but no direct observational evidence is available to test these models. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) offered direct imaging of nearby SMBHs, in particular, the one at the center of the Milky Way Galaxy named Sgr~A*. Measurements suggest that the Sgr~A* BH spins rapidly with significant spin axis misalignment relative to the angular momentum of the Galactic plane. Through investigating various SMBH growth models, here we show that the spin properties of Sgr~A* provides strong evidence of a past SMBH merger. Inspired by the merger between the Milky Way and Gaia-Enceladus, which has a 4:1 mass ratio as inferred from Gaia data, we have discovered that a 4:1 major merger of SMBH with a binary angular momentum inclination angle of 15-45 degrees with respect to the line of sight (LOS), can successfully replicate the measured spin properties of Sgr A*. This merger event in our galaxy provides observational support for the theory of hierarchical BH mergers in the formation and growth of SMBHs. The inferred merger rate, consistent with theoretical predictions, suggests a promising detection rate of SMBH mergers for space-borne gravitational wave detectors expected to operate in 2030s.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

For type-1 AGN, the black hole mass was determined from MgII emission lines while the black hole mass of type-2 AGN was inferred from the host galaxy's stellar mass. Based on the derived parameters, the distribution of the sample in the absorption hydrogen column density ($N_{\rm H}$) vs. Eddington ratio diagram is examined. Among the type-2 AGN, $28\pm5$\% are in the forbidden zone, where the obscuration by dust torus cannot be maintained due to radiation pressure on dusty material. The fraction is higher than that observed in the local universe from the BAT AGN Spectroscopic Survey (BASS) data release 2 ($11\pm3$\%). The higher fraction implies that the obscuration of the majority of AGN is consistent with the radiation pressure regulated unified model but with an increased incidence of interstellar matter (ISM) obscured AGN. We discuss the possibility of dust-free absorption in type-1 AGN and heavy ISM absorption in type-2 AGN.

Near-term quantum computers may bring considerable advantage for the efficient simulation of their static and dynamical properties, thanks to hybrid quantum-classical variational algorithms to approximate the dynamics of the density matrix describing the quantum state in terms of an ensemble average. Here, a variational quantum algorithm is developed to simulate the real-time evolution of the density matrix governed by the Lindblad master equation, under the assumption that the quantum state has a bounded entropy along the dynamics, entailing a low-rank representation of its density matrix. The algorithm encodes each pure state of the statistical mixture as a parametrized quantum circuit, and the associated probabilities as additional variational parameters stored classically, thereby requiring a significantly lower number of qubits than algorithms where the full density matrix is encoded in the quantum memory. Two variational Ansätze are proposed, and their effectiveness is assessed in the simulation of the dynamics of a 2D dissipative transverse field Ising model.

Qubit-Wise Architecture Search Method for Variational Quantum Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04268v1,"Jialin Chen, Zhiqiang Cai, Ke Xu, Di Wu, Wei Cao","Considering the noise level limit, one crucial aspect for quantum machine learning is to design a high-performing variational quantum circuit architecture with small number of quantum gates.

Error Correction in Dynamical Codes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04163v1,"Xiaozhen Fu, Daniel Gottesman","We ask what is the general framework for a quantum error correcting code that is defined by a sequence of measurements. Recently, there has been much interest in Floquet codes and space-time codes. In this work, we define and study the distance of a dynamical code. This is a subtle concept and difficult to determine: At any given time, the system will be in a subspace which forms a quantum error-correcting code with a given distance, but the full error correction capability of that code may not be available due to the schedule of measurements associated with the code. We address this challenge by developing an algorithm that tracks information we have learned about the error syndromes through the protocol and put that together to determine the distance of a dynamical code, in a non-fault-tolerant context. We use the tools developed for the algorithm to analyze the initialization and masking properties of a generic Floquet code. Further, we look at properties of dynamical codes under the constraint of geometric locality with a view to understand whether the fundamental limitations on logical gates and code parameters imposed by geometric locality for traditional codes can be surpassed in the dynamical paradigm. We find that codes with a limited number of long range connectivity will not allow non-Clifford gates to be implemented with finite depth circuits in the 2D setting.",{'quantum error-correcting code': 1},03.2024,2024,03,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

For these EKBHs, the probability of ever absorbing a photon or other particle from the cosmic environment is small, even in the cores of galaxies.

The impact of AGN X-ray selection on the AGN halo occupation distribution,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03978v1,"M. C. Powell, M. Krumpe, A. Coil, T. Miyaji","The connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host dark matter halos provides powerful insights into how supermassive black holes (SMBHs) grow and coevolve with their host galaxies. Here we investigate the impact of observational AGN selection on the AGN halo occupation distribution (HOD) by forward-modeling AGN activity into cosmological N-body simulations. By assuming straightforward relationships between the SMBH mass, galaxy mass, and (sub)halo mass, as well as a uniform broken power law distribution of Eddington ratios, we find that luminosity-limited AGN samples result in biased HOD shapes. While AGN defined by an Eddington ratio threshold produce AGN fractions that are flat across halo mass (unbiased by definition), luminosity-limited AGN fractions peak around galaxy-group-sized halo masses and then decrease with increasing halo mass. With higher luminosities, the rise of the AGN fraction starts at higher halo masses, the peak is shifted towards higher halo masses, and the decline at higher halo masses is more rapid. These results are consistent with recent HOD constraints from AGN clustering measurements, which find (1) characteristic halo mass scales of $\log M_{Vir}\sim$ 12 - 13 [$h^{-1}M_{\odot}$] and (2) a shallower rise of the number of satellite AGN with increasing halo mass than for the overall galaxy population. Thus the observational biases due to AGN selection can naturally explain the constant, characteristic halo mass scale inferred from large-scale AGN clustering amplitudes over a range of redshifts, as well as the measured inconsistencies between AGN and galaxy HODs. We conclude that AGN selection biases can have significant impacts on the inferred AGN HOD, and can therefore lead to possible misinterpretations of how AGN populate dark matter halos and the AGN-host galaxy connection.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

How open is the asteroid-mass primordial black hole window?,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03839v1,"Matthew Gorton, Anne M.

Observational constraints on the abundance of PBHs are usually calculated assuming they all have the same mass, however this is unlikely to be a good approximation. PBHs formed from the collapse of large density perturbations during radiation domination are expected to have an extended mass function (MF), due to the effects of critical collapse. The PBH MF is often assumed to be lognormal, however it has recently been shown that other functions are a better fit to numerically calculated MFs. We recalculate both current and potential future constraints for these improved fitting functions. We find that for current constraints the asteroid-mass window narrows, but remains open (i.e. all of the DM can be in the form of PBHs) unless the PBH MF is wider than expected. Future evaporation and microlensing constraints may together exclude all of the DM being in PBHs, depending on the width of the PBH MF and also the shape of its low and high mass tails.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Building on this key insight (also elaborated with examples), we introduce indefinite causal order to quantum machine learning. Because the indefinite causal order of quantum gates allows for the superposition of different orders, the performance of quantum machine learning can be significantly enhanced.

The finite-temperature absorption, steady-stat emission, and time-resolved emission spectra are then computed using powerful, numerically exact tensor network approaches. We find that the dual fluorescence in vacuum is driven by a single well-defined coupling mode, but is quenched in solution due to dynamic solvent-driven symmetry-breaking that mixes the two low-lying electronic states.

On the other hand, we illustrate how to avoid failure scenarios for the conjecture, emphasizing the features for a physically reasonable disc galaxy dragging model. In particular, we stress that the non-linearities of the Einstein Equations must play an essential role in generating what we define as ``pseudo-solitonic"" solutions -- the only non-trivial physically viable solutions for the class of models considered. Furthermore, the dragging vortex is proven to show important contributions to the gravitational lensing in these models, thus providing an ulterior measure of its relevance. Moreover, by qualitatively exploring these pseudo-solitonic solutions, we find that a dragging speed of just a few kilometers per second would be enough to explain a non-negligible fraction of the galactic dark matter.

Primordial black hole formation processes with full numerical relativity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02878v1,Eloy de Jong,"See thesis for complete abstract.
  Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form in the early universe, and there are several mass windows in which their abundance today may be large enough to comprise a significant part of the dark matter density. Additionally, numerical relativity (NR) allows one to investigate the formation processes of PBHs in the fully nonlinear strong-gravity regime. In this thesis, we will describe the use of NR methods to study PBH formation, motivated in particular by open questions about the nonspherical effects PBH formation in a matter-dominated early universe.
  We demonstrate that superhorizon non-linear perturbations can collapse and form PBHs via the direct collapse or the accretion collapse mechanisms in a matter-dominated universe. The heaviest perturbations collapse via the direct collapse mechanism, while lighter perturbations trigger an accretion process that causes a rapid collapse of the ambient DM. From the hoop conjecture we propose an analytic criterion to determine whether a given perturbation will collapse via the direct or accretion mechanism and we compute the timescale of collapse. Independent of the formation mechanism, the PBH forms within an efold after collapse is initiated and with a small initial mass compared to the Hubble horizon, $M_\textrm{BH} H_0\sim 10^{-2}m_\mathrm{Pl}^2$. Finally, we find that PBH formation is followed by extremely rapid growth $M_\textrm{BH}\propto H^{-β}$ with $β\gg 1$, during which the PBH acquires most of its mass.
  Furthermore, we study the formation of spinning primordial black holes during an early matter-dominated era. Using non-linear 3+1D general relativistic simulations, we compute the efficiency of mass and angular momentum transfer in the process -- which we find to be $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$.

Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02481v1,"Themba Hodge, Eric Mascot, Dan Crawford, Stephan Rachel","Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents an accessible method to track transitions within the low-energy subspace and predict the output of braids with hybridized Majorana modes. As an application, we characterize Pauli qubit-errors, as demonstrated on an X-gate, critical for the successful operation of any quantum computer. Further, we perform numerical simulations to demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement arbitrary rotations, along with a two-qubit controlled magic gate, thus providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.",{'quantum computer': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Signatures of ultralight bosons in the orbital eccentricity of binary black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02415v1,"Mateja Bošković, Matthias Koschnitzke, Rafael A. Porto","We show that the existence of clouds of ultralight particles surrounding black holes during their cosmological history as members of a binary system can leave a measurable imprint on the distribution of masses and orbital eccentricities observable with future gravitational-wave detectors. Notably, we find that for nonprecessing binaries with chirp masses ${\cal M} \lesssim 10\,M_\odot$, formed exclusively in isolation, larger-than-expected values of the eccentricity, i.e. $e\gtrsim 10^{-2}$ at gravitational-wave frequencies $f_{\rm GW} \simeq 10^{-2}\,$Hz, would provide tantalizing evidence for a new particle of mass between $[0.5,2.5] \times 10^{-12}\,$eV in nature. The predicted evolution of the eccentricity can also drastically affect the in-band phase evolution and peak frequency. These results constitute unique signatures of boson clouds of ultralight particles in the dynamics of binary black holes, which will be readily accessible with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, as well as future mid-band and Deci-hertz detectors.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Classification of the Fashion-MNIST Dataset on a Quantum Computer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02405v1,"Kevin Shen, Bernhard Jobst, Elvira Shishenina, Frank Pollmann","The potential impact of quantum machine learning algorithms on industrial applications remains an exciting open question. Conventional methods for encoding classical data into quantum computers are not only too costly for a potential quantum advantage in the algorithms but also severely limit the scale of feasible experiments on current hardware. Therefore, recent works, despite claiming the near-term suitability of their algorithms, do not provide experimental benchmarking on standard machine learning datasets. We attempt to solve the data encoding problem by improving a recently proposed variational algorithm [1] that approximately prepares the encoded data, using asymptotically shallow circuits that fit the native gate set and topology of currently available quantum computers. We apply the improved algorithm to encode the Fashion-MNIST dataset [2], which can be directly used in future empirical studies of quantum machine learning algorithms. We deploy simple quantum variational classifiers trained on the encoded dataset on a current quantum computer ibmq-kolkata [3] and achieve moderate accuracies, providing a proof of concept for the near-term usability of our data encoding method.","{'quantum computer': 1, 'quantum machine learning': 2}",03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Impact of unmodeled eccentricity on the tidal deformability measurement and implications for gravitational wave physics inference,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02404v1,"Poulami Dutta Roy, Pankaj Saini","With the expected large number of binary neutron star (BNS) observations through gravitational waves (GWs), third-generation GW detectors, Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), will be able to constrain the tidal deformability, and hence the equation of state (EoS) of neutron star (NS) with exquisite precision. A subset of the detected BNS systems can retain residual eccentricity in the detector frequency band. We study the systematic errors due to unmodeled eccentricity in the tidal deformability measurement and its implications for NS EoS and redshift measurement via the Love siren method. We find that the systematic errors in the tidal deformability parameter exceed the statistical errors at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ ($\sim 3\times 10^{-4}$) at $10$Hz reference GW frequency for CE (ET). We show that these biases on tidal deformability parameter can significantly bias the NS EoS inference. Furthermore, the error on tidal deformability propagates to the source frame NS mass, which in turn biases the redshift inference. For CE, the redshift inference is significantly biased at an eccentricity of $\sim 10^{-3}$ (at a reference frequency of $10$Hz). We also study the implications of biased tidal deformability in testing the Kerr nature of black holes. Systematic error on the tidal deformability parameter leads to a non-zero value of tidal deformability for binary black holes, indicating a false deviation from the Kerr nature. Finally, we show that including eccentricity in the waveform model increases the statistical errors in tidal deformability measurement by a factor of $\lesssim 2$. Our study, therefore, highlights the importance of using accurate eccentric waveform models for GW parameter inference.",{'black holes': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Ratajczak","The gravitational wave detectors have unveiled a population of massive black holes that do not resemble those observed in the Milky Way. They may have formed due to the evolution of massive low-metallicity stars, dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments, or density fluctuations in the very early Universe (primordial black holes). If the latter hypothesis is correct, primordial black holes should comprise from several to 100% of dark matter to explain the black hole merger rates observed by gravitational wave detectors. If such black holes existed in the Milky Way dark matter halo, they would cause long-timescale gravitational microlensing events lasting years. Here, we present the results of the search for the long-timescale microlensing events among the light curves of 78.7 million stars located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) that were monitored for 20 years (2001-2020) by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. We did not find any events with timescales longer than one year. The properties of all thirteen microlensing events with timescales shorter than one year detected by OGLE toward the LMC can be explained by astrophysical objects located either in the LMC itself or in the Milky Way disk, without the need to invoke dark matter in the form of compact objects. We find that compact objects in the mass range from $1.8 \times 10^{-4}\,M_{\odot}$ to $6.3\,M_{\odot}$ cannot compose more than 1% of dark matter, and compact objects in the mass range from $1.3 \times 10^{-5}\,M_{\odot}$ to $860\,M_{\odot}$ cannot make up more than 10% of dark matter.

Relational bulk reconstruction from modular flow,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02377v1,"Onkar Parrikar, Harshit Rajgadia, Vivek Singh, Jonathan Sorce","The entanglement wedge reconstruction paradigm in AdS/CFT states that for a bulk qudit within the entanglement wedge of a boundary subregion $\bar{A}$, operators acting on the bulk qudit can be reconstructed as CFT operators on $\bar{A}$. This naturally fits within the framework of quantum error correction, with the CFT states containing the bulk qudit forming a code protected against the erasure of the boundary subregion $A$. In this paper, we set up and study a framework for relational bulk reconstruction in holography: given two code subspaces both protected against erasure of the boundary region $A$, the goal is to relate the operator reconstructions between the two spaces. To accomplish this, we assume that the two code subspaces are smoothly connected by a one-parameter family of codes all protected against the erasure of $A$, and that the maximally-entangled states on these codes are all full-rank. We argue that such code subspaces can naturally be constructed in holography in a ""measurement-based"" setting. In this setting, we derive a flow equation for the operator reconstruction of a fixed code subspace operator using modular theory which can, in principle, be integrated to relate the reconstructed operators all along the flow. We observe a striking resemblance between our formulas for relational bulk reconstruction and the infinite-time limit of Connes cocycle flow, and take some steps towards making this connection more rigorous. We also provide alternative derivations of our reconstruction formulas in terms of a canonical reconstruction map we call the modular reflection operator.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'holography': 2}",03.2024,2024,03,['Holography']
Asymptotically-Flat Black Hole Solutions in Symmergent Gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02373v1,"Beyhan Puliçe, Reggie C. Pantig, Ali Övgün, Durmuş Demir","Symmergent gravity is an emergent gravity model with an $R+R^2$ curvature sector and an extended particle sector having new particles beyond the known ones. With constant scalar curvature, asymptotically flat black hole solutions are known to have no sensitivity to the quadratic curvature term (coefficient of $R^2$). With variable scalar curvature, however, asymptotically-flat symmergent black hole solutions turn out to explicitly depend on the quadratic curvature term. In the present work, we construct asymptotically-flat symmergent black holes with variable scalar curvature and use its evaporation, shadow, and deflection angle to constrain the symmergent gravity parameters. Concerning their evaporation, we find that the new particles predicted by symmergent gravity, even if they do not interact with the known particles, can enhance the black hole evaporation rate. Concerning their shadow, we show that statistically significant symmergent effects are reached at the $2\,σ$ level for the observational data of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) on the Sagittarius A* supermassive black hole. Concerning their weak deflection angle, we reveal discernible features for the boson-fermion number differences, particularly at large impact parameters.

Then, from the perspective of entropy inside the co-moving volume, we find that there exists a universal definition for this special class of spatial systems, i.e., the definition is independent of the components of the universe. Finally, we prove that in some specific cosmological models, multiple definitions can arise for this special class of spatial systems, and we analyze the underlying reasons for the emergence of these multiple definitions.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem, and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics in Machine Learning (CAMEL) Simulations, using three suites: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying 6 parameters (2 cosmological & 4 astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites, owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons, reducing the sightline-to-sightline variance in DMs between z=0-1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive AGN feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Here we report an unusually bright LRD ($z=3.1$) observed as part of the RUBIES program. This LRD exhibits broad emission lines (FWHM $\sim4000$km/s), a blue UV continuum, a clear Balmer break and a red continuum sampled out to rest 4 $μ$m with MIRI. We develop a new joint galaxy and AGN model within the Prospector Bayesian inference framework and perform spectrophotometric modeling using NIRCam, MIRI, and NIRSpec/Prism observations. Our fiducial model reveals a $M_*\sim 10^9M_\odot$ galaxy alongside a dust-reddened AGN driving the optical emission. Explaining the rest-frame optical color as a reddened AGN requires $A_{\rm v}\gtrsim4$, suggesting that a great majority of the accretion disk energy is re-radiated as dust emission. Yet despite clear AGN signatures, we find a surprising lack of hot torus emission, which implies that either the dust emission in this object must be cold, or the red continuum must instead be driven by a massive, evolved stellar population of the host galaxy -- seemingly inconsistent with the high EW broad lines (H$α$ EW $\sim800$Å). The widths and luminosities of Pa$β$, Pa$δ$, Pa$γ$, and H$α$ imply a modest black hole mass of $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^8M_\odot$. Additionally, we identify a narrow blue-shifted HeI absorption in G395M spectra, signaling an ionized outflow with kinetic energy up to $\sim1$\% the luminosity of the AGN. The low redshift of RUBIES-BLAGN-1 combined with the depth and richness of the JWST imaging and spectroscopic observations provide a unique opportunity to build a physical model for these so-far mysterious LRDs, which may prove to be a crucial phase in the early formation of massive galaxies and their supermassive black holes.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Projective path to points at infinity in spherically symmetric spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02128v1,"Donato Bini, Giampiero Esposito","This paper points out that, in a four-dimensional spacetime manifold, the four coordinates of any point may be viewed as arising from five homogeneous coordinates according to the well-established recipes of projective geometry. Moreover, if the homogeneous coordinates change by a linear transformation, ruled by the coefficients of a matrix of the group GL(5,R), this induces a fractional linear transformation of spherically symmetric spacetime coordinates which can be exploited to bring infinity down to a finite distance. The boundary of spherically symmetric spacetimes here studied is the disjoint union of three points: future timelike infinity, past timelike infinity, spacelike infinity, and the three-dimensional products of half-lines with a 2-sphere. For the single points, the underlying structure is a projective map which destroys the 2-sphere, whereas the two products of a half-line with the 2-sphere arise from a projective map which preserves the 2-sphere. Geodesics are then studied in the projectively transformed (t',r',theta',phi') coordinates for Schwarzschild spacetime, with special interest in their way of approaching our points at infinity. Next, Nariai and de Sitter spacetimes are studied with our projective method.

Israr Aslam, Xiao-Xiong Zeng, Rabia Saleem, Xin-Yun Hu","We study the Einstein images of a charged Rastall AdS black hole (BH) within the fabric of AdS/CFT correspondence. Considering the holographic setup, we analyze the amplitude of the total response function for various values of model parameters. With an increase in parameter $λ$ and temperature $T$, the amplitude of the response function is decreased, while it is increased with the increase of the electric charge $e$ and chemical potential $μ$. The influence of frequency $ω$ also plays an important role in the bulk field, as it is found that the decreasing $ω$ leads to an increase in the periods of the waves, which means that the amplitude of the response function also depends on the wave source. The relation between $T$ to the inverse of the horizon $r_{h}$ for the parameter $λ$ is interpreted under fixed values of other involved parameters. These, in turn, affect the behavior of the response function and the Einstein ring, which may be used to differentiate the present work from previous studies. Via a special optical system, we construct the holographic images of the BH in bulk. The obtained results show that the Einstein ring always appears with concentric stripes at the position of the north pole, and this ring transforms into the luminosity-deformed ring or bright light spot when the distant observer lies away from the north pole. Moreover, from the brightness profiles, it is observed that as $λ$ grows, the shadow radius is significantly decreased, while the brightness of the ring is negligibly changed. We further investigate the influence of $T$ and $μ$ on the ring radius. These results reveal that the increasing values of $T$ lead to an increase in the shadow radius and decrease as the values of $μ$ grow.

Firstly, we explore the validity of the null, weak, dominant and strong energy conditions for wormhole matter for the considered $f(R,T)=R+αR^2+λT$ model. Research shows that it is possible to obtain traversable WH geometry without bring in exotic matter that violates the null energy condition in the $f(R,T)$ theory. The violation of the dominant energy condition in this model may be related to quantum fluctuations or indicates the existence of special matter that violates this EC within the wormhole. Moreover, it is found that in the $f(R,T)=R+αR^2+λT$ model, relative to the GR, the introduction of the geometric term $αR^2$ has no remarkable impact on the wormhole matter components and their properties, while the appearance of the matter-geometry coupling term $λT$ can resolve the question that WH matter violates the null, weak and strong energy condition in GR. Additionally, we investigate dependency of the valid NEC on model parameters and quantify the matter components within the wormhole using the ``volume integral quantifier"". Lastly, based on the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov equation, we find that the traversable WH in this theory is stable. On the other hand, we use the classical reconstruction technique to derive wormhole solution in $f(R,T)$ theory and discuss the corresponding ECs of matter. It is found that all four ECs (NEC, WEC, SEC and DEC) of matter in the traversable wormholes are valid in this reconstructed $f(R,T)$ model, i.e we provide a wormhole solution without introducing the exotic matter and special matter in $f(R,T)$ theory.",{'traversable wormholes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Radio AGN jet alignment: Radio and Optical Position Angle of Radio Galaxies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01707v1,"Xuechen Zheng, Yuze Zhang, Huub Röttgering","It is well established that AGNs play an important role in the evolution of galaxies. These AGNs can be linked to the accretion processes onto massive black holes and past merger events in their host galaxies, which may lead to different alignments of the jets with respect to the host galaxies. This paper presents a study of the PA differences between radio and optical images of radio AGNs based on the LoTSS DR2, the FIRST, the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and the SDSS. We assessed PA measurement biases in the data and classified the radio AGNs based on the radio luminosity and infrared colour from the WISE. This resulted in the largest yet published sample of 3682 radio AGNs with reliable radio and optical PA measurements. The PA difference (dPA) distributions for the radio AGN sample show a prominent minor-axis alignment tendency. Based on some simple assumptions, we simulated the projection effect to estimate the intrinsic jet-galaxy alignment. The observed dPA distribution can be well described by a two-component jet-alignment model in which one component is more aligned with the minor axis of the host galaxy than the other. The fitting results indicate that the jet alignment is dependent on radio luminosity and the shape of the host galaxies, with the jets being more likely to be aligned with the minor axis of the galaxy for lower radio luminosity and for optically more elongated radio AGNs. The minor-axis alignment of the entire sample may suggest a coherent accretion model present in most AGN host galaxies, while a considerable number of luminous radio-AGN with massive host galaxies might have undergone an accretion according to the chaotic model or past merger events.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']
Computing exact moments of local random quantum circuits via tensor networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01706v1,"Paolo Braccia, Pablo Bermejo, Lukasz Cincio, M. Cerezo","A basic primitive in quantum information is the computation of the moments $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[UρU^\dagger O]^t]$. These describe the distribution of expectation values obtained by sending a state $ρ$ through a random unitary $U$, sampled from some distribution, and measuring the observable $O$. While the exact calculation of these moments is generally hard, if $U$ is composed of local random gates, one can estimate $\mathbb{E}_U[{\rm Tr}[UρU^\dagger O]^t]$ by performing Monte Carlo simulations of a Markov chain-like process. However, this approach can require a prohibitively large number of samples, or suffer from the sign problem. In this work, we instead propose to estimate the moments via tensor networks, where the local gates moment operators are mapped to small dimensional tensors acting on their local commutant bases. By leveraging representation theoretical tools, we study the local tensor dimension and we provide bounds for the bond dimension of the matrix product states arising from deep circuits. We compare our techniques against Monte Carlo simulations, showing that we can significantly out-perform them. Then, we showcase how tensor networks can exactly compute the second moment when $U$ is a quantum neural network acting on thousands of qubits and having thousands of gates. To finish, we numerically study the anticoncentration phenomena of circuits with orthogonal random gates, a task which cannot be studied via Monte Carlo due to sign problems.",{'tensor networks': 2},03.2024,2024,03,['Tensor Networks']
Inverted-circuit zero-noise extrapolation for quantum gate error mitigation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01608v1,"Kathrin F. Koenig, Finn Reinecke, Walter Hahn, Thomas Wellens","A common approach to deal with gate errors in modern quantum-computing hardware is zero-noise extrapolation. By artificially amplifying errors and extrapolating the expectation values obtained with different error strengths towards the zero-error (zero-noise) limit, the technique aims at rectifying errors in noisy quantum computing systems. For an accurate extrapolation, it is essential to know the exact factors of the noise amplification. In this article, we propose a simple method for estimating the strength of errors occurring in a quantum circuit and demonstrate improved extrapolation results. The method determines the error strength for a circuit by appending to it the inverted circuit and measuring the probability of the initial state. The estimation of error strengths is easy to implement for arbitrary circuits and does not require a previous characterisation of noise properties. We compare this method with the conventional zero-noise extrapolation method and show that the novel method leads to a more accurate calculation of expectation values. Our method proves to be particularly effective on current hardware, showcasing its suitability for near-term quantum computing applications.",{'quantum circuit': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Una interpretacion de colapso objetivo para los problemas de la medida y la clasicalizacion donde no se conserva la informacion,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01584v1,Eduardo Franco Sotelo Bazán,"In this work was researched the problems of classicalization and measurement unifying them in a single problem: the problem of collapse, for this purpose was developed a working program -- the classicalization's program -- in an interpretation of objective collapse that was proposed for this purpose, and which overcomes the limitations of the official interpretation. This program explain that the classicization arises by alternating the unitary evolution and the collapses, due to the redistribution of energy, so the classical mechanics emerges as a good approximation; however, was defined deep chaos as the regime where macrosystems are so sensitive to the initial conditions that are affected by the collapses and indeterminism of quantum mechanics, allowing the emergence of thermodynamics with its irreversibility; at this level the observation occurs because the measurement device (classic) extends their collapses at microsystem through quantum entanglement. In this work, was did an extension of the classicalization's program at the black holes, and was explained -- at a level still in development -- about the role of the collapses in its thermodynamic; in addition, the program of quantum decoherence was critized, and was presented a theory of physical information that was developing.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

However, due to the noise and the limited scale of current quantum computers, may prominent quantum algorithms are currently infeasible to run for problem sizes of practical interest. This doctoral thesis develops two main techniques to reduce the quantum computational resource requirements, with the goal of scaling up application sizes on current quantum processors. The first approach is based on stochastic approximations of computationally costly quantities, such as quantum circuit gradients or the quantum geometric tensor (QGT). The second method takes a different perspective on the QGT, leading to a potentially more efficient description of time evolution on current quantum computers. While the main focus of application for our algorithms is the simulation of quantum systems, the developed subroutines can further be utilized in the fields of optimization or machine learning. Our algorithms are benchmarked on a range of representative models, such as Ising or Heisenberg spin models, both in numerical simulations and experiments on the hardware.

Interestingly enough, the existence of primordial NG can leave imprints on the clustering properties of PBHs and the spectral shape of induced GW signals. Focusing on a scale-dependent local-type NG, we identify a distinct double-peaked GW energy spectrum that, contingent upon $M_{\text{PBH}}$ and the abundance of PBHs at the time of formation, denoted as $Ω_\mathrm{PBH,f}$, may fall into the frequency bands of upcoming GW observatories, including LISA, ET, SKA, and BBO. Thus, such a signal can serve as a novel portal for probing primordial NGs. Intriguingly, combining BBN bounds on the GW amplitude, we find for the first time the joint limit on the product of the effective non-linearity parameter for the primordial tri-spectrum, denoted by $\barτ_\mathrm{NL}$, and the primordial curvature perturbation power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k)$, which reads as $\barτ_\mathrm{NL} \mathcal{P}_{\cal R}(k) < 4\times 10^{-20} Ω^{-17/9}_\mathrm{PBH,f} \left( \frac{M_{\rm PBH}}{10^4\mathrm{g}} \right)^{-17/9}$.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Observational Evidence for Hot Wind Impact on pc-scale in Low-luminosity Active Galactic Nucleus,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00479v1,"Fangzheng Shi, Feng Yuan, Zhiyuan Li, Zhao Su, Suoqing Ji","Supermassive black holes in galaxies spend majority of their lifetime in the low-luminosity regime, powered by hot accretion flow. Strong winds launched from the hot accretion flow have the potential to play an important role in active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. Direct observational evidence for these hot winds with temperature around 10 keV, has been obtained through the detection of highly ionized iron emission lines with Doppler shifts in two prototypical low-luminosity AGNs, namely M81* and NGC 7213. In this work, we further identify blueshifted H-like O/Ne emission lines in the soft X-ray spectra of these two sources. These lines are interpreted to be associated with additional outflowing components possessing velocity around several $10^3$ km/s and lower temperature (~0.2-0.4 keV). Blue-shifted velocity and the X-ray intensity of these additional outflowing components are hard to be explained by previously detected hot wind freely propagating to larger radii. Through detailed numerical simulations, we find the newly detected blue-shifted emission lines would come from circumnuclear gas shock-heated by the hot wind instead. Hot wind can provide larger ram pressure force on the clumpy circumnuclear gas than the gravitational force from central black hole, effectively impeding the black hole accretion of gas. Our results provide strong evidences for the energy and momentum feedback by the hot AGN wind.",{'black holes': 1},03.2024,2024,03,['Black Holes and GR']

Here, we demonstrate an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that does not rely on this homogeneous-object assumption and is a generalization of the well-established contrast-transfer-function (CTF) approach. We then investigate its stability and present an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithm with established methods.

The central region in each galaxy contains a circumnuclear disk that exhibits orderly rotation with projected line-of-sight velocities of ${\sim} 270\, \mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s^{-1}}$. We build gas-dynamical models for the rotating disk in each galaxy and fit them directly to the ALMA data cubes. At $0.31^{\prime \prime}$resolution, the ALMA observations do not fully resolve the black hole sphere of influence (SOI), and neither galaxy exhibits a central rise in rotation speed, indicating that emission from deep within the SOI is not detected. As a result, our models do not tightly constrain the central black hole mass in either galaxy, but they prefer the presence of a central massive object in both galaxies. We measure the black hole mass to be $(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/10^8\, M_{\odot}) = 5.0 \pm 0.2 \,[\mathrm{1σ\,statistical}] \,^{+1.4}_{-1.3} \,[\mathrm{systematic}]$ in NGC 4786 and $(M_{\mathrm{BH}}/10^8\, M_{\odot}) = 1.4 \pm 0.03 \, [\mathrm{1σ\,statistical}] ^{+1.5}_{-0.1} \,[\mathrm{systematic}]$ in NGC 5193.

Enabling large-depth simulation of noisy quantum circuits with positive tensor networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00152v1,"Ambroise Müller, Thomas Ayral, Corentin Bertrand","Matrix product density operators (MPDOs) are tensor network representations of locally purified density matrices where each physical degree of freedom is associated to an environment degree of freedom. MPDOs have interesting properties for mixed state representations: guaranteed positivity by construction, efficient conservation of the trace and computation of local observables. However, they have been challenging to use for noisy quantum circuit simulation, as the application of noise increases the dimension of the environment Hilbert space, leading to an exponential growth of bond dimensions. MPDOs also lack a unique canonical form, due to the freedom in the choice of basis for the environment Hilbert space, which leads to a vast variation of bond dimensions.
  In this work, we present a systematic way to reduce the bond dimensions of MPDOs by disentangling the purified state. We optimize the basis for the environment Hilbert space by performing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG)-like sweeps of local 2-qubit basis optimization. Interestingly, we find that targeting only the disentanglement of the purified state leads to a reduction of the environment dimension. In other words, a compact MPDO representation requires a low-entanglement purified state.
  We apply our compression method to the emulation of noisy random quantum circuits. Our technique allows us to keep bounded bond dimensions, and thus bounded memory, contrary to previous works on MPDOs, while keeping reasonable truncation fidelities.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'random quantum circuits': 1, 'tensor network': 1}",03.2024,2024,03,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Latest results claim supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in these systems to be significantly more massive than expected from the local BH mass - stellar mass ($\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$) relation and that this is not due to sample selection effects. Through detailed statistical modeling, we demonstrate that the coupled effects of selection biases (i.e., finite detection limit and requirements on detecting broad lines) and measurement uncertainties in $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH}$ and $\mathcal{M}_\star$ can in fact largely account for the reported offset and flattening in the observed $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation toward the upper envelope of the local relation, even for those at $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} < 10^8\,M_{\odot}$. We further investigate the possible evolution of the $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation at $z\gtrsim 4$ with careful treatment of observational biases and consideration of the degeneracy between intrinsic evolution and dispersion in this relation. The bias-corrected intrinsic $\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} - \mathcal{M}_\star$ relation in the low-mass regime suggests that there might be a large population of low-mass BHs (${\rm log}\,\mathcal{M}_{\rm BH} \lesssim 5$), possibly originating from lighter seeds, remaining undetected or unidentified even in the deepest JWST surveys.

Probing AGN jet precession with LISA,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00066v1,"Nathan Steinle, Davide Gerosa, Martin G. H. Krause","The precession of astrophysical jets produced by active-galactic nuclei is likely related to the dynamics of the accretion disks surrounding the central supermassive black holes (BHs) from which jets are launched. The two main mechanisms that can drive jet precession arise from Lense-Thirring precession and tidal torquing. These can explain direct and indirect observations of precessing jets; however, such explanations often utilize crude approximations of the disk evolution and observing jet precession can be challenging with electromagnetic facilities. Simultaneously, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is expected to measure gravitational waves from the mergers of massive binary BHs with high accuracy and probe their progenitor evolution. In this paper, we connect the LISA detectability of binary BH mergers to the possible jet precession during their progenitor evolution. We make use of a semi-analytic model that self-consistently treats disk-driven BH alignment and binary inspiral and includes the possibility of disk breaking. We find that tidal torquing of the accretion disk provides a wide range of jet precession timescales depending on the binary separation and the spin direction of the BH from which the jet is launched. Efficient disk-driven BH alignment results in shorter timescales of $\sim 1$ yr which are correlated with higher LISA signal-to-noise ratios. Disk breaking results in the longest possible times of $\sim 10^7$ yrs, suggesting a deep interplay between the disk critical obliquity (i.e. where the disk breaks) and jet precession.

We do not find any significant candidates, but determine the maximum luminosity distance reachable with our search to be of $O(0.1-100)$ kpc, and corresponding model-independent upper limits on the merger rate densities to be $O(10^{3}-10^{-7})$ kpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$ for systems with chirp masses $O(10^{-4}-10^{-2})M_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we interpret these rate densities as arising from PBH binaries, and thereby constrain the fraction of dark matter that these objects could compose.

In this work, we study this type of induced GWs within the context of string-inspired running-vaccuum models (StRVMs), which, when expanded around de Sitter backgrounds, include logarithmic corrections of the space-time curvature. In particular, we discuss in detail the effects of StRVMs on the source as well as on the propagation of these PBH-induced GWs. Remarkably, under the assumption that the logarithmic terms represent quantum gravity corrections in the PBH era, we show that GW overproduction can be avoided if one assumes a coefficient of these logarithmic corrections that is much larger than the square of the reduced Planck mass. The latter cannot characterise quantum gravity corrections, though, prompting the need for revision of the quantisation of StRVMs in different than de Sitter backgrounds, such as those characterising PBH-driven eMD eras.

Using nonholonomic frames with dyadic spacetime splitting and applying the AFCDM, we prove that such systems of PDEs can be decoupled and integrated in general forms for generic off-diagonal metric structures and generalized affine connections. We generate new classes of quasi-stationary solutions (which do not depend on time like coordinates) and study the physical properties of some physically important examples. Such exact or parametric solutions are determined by nonmetric solitonic distributions and/or ellipsoidal deformations of wormhole hole configurations. It is not possible to describe the thermodynamic properties of such solutions in the framework of the Bekenstein-Hawking paradigm because such metrics do not involve, in general, certain horizons, duality, or holographic configurations.

A Rigorous Holographic Bound on AdS Scale Separation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19358v1,Eric Perlmutter,"We give an elementary proof of the following property of unitary, interacting four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories: at large central charge $c$, there exist at least $\sqrt{c}$ single-trace, scalar superconformal primary operators with dimensions $Δ\lesssim \sqrt{c}$ (suppressing multiplicative logarithmic corrections). This follows from a stronger, more refined bound on the spectral density in terms of the asymptotic growth rate of the central charge. The proof employs known results on the structure of Coulomb branch operators. Interpreted holographically, this bounds the possible degree of scale separation in semiclassical AdS$_5$ half-maximal supergravity. In particular, the bulk must contain an infinite tower of charged scalar states of energies parametrically below the large black hole threshold, $E_{\rm BH} \sim c$.

Low Depth Virtual Distillation of Quantum Circuits by Deterministic Circuit Decomposition,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18874v1,"Akib Karim, Shaobo Zhang, Muhammad Usman","Virtual distillation (VD) using measurements of multiple copies of a quantum circuit have recently been proposed as a method of noise mitigation of expectation values. Circuit decompositions known as B gates were found only for single qubit expectation values however practical calculations require multi-qubit expectation values which cannot be corrected with B gates. We discover low depth circuit decompositions for multi-qubit expectation values by combining multiple projections to recover the correct measurement statistics or expectation values. Our method adds linear entangling gates with number of qubits, but requires extra measurements. Furthermore, in applications to find ground states such as the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, the variational principle is required which states the energy cannot go below the ground state energy. We discover that the variational principle is violated if noise is higher on single expectation values than multi-qubit which renders VQE useless. We show this occurs when using B gates and is preserved if using our low depth decomposition on all expectation values. We perform demonstration on real devices and demonstrate our decomposition can mitigate real experimental noise in VQE for the H$_2$ molecule with a two qubit tapered mapping, H$_3$ with three qubits, and H$_2$ with four qubits. Our decomposition provides a way to perform duplicate circuit virtual distillation on real devices at significantly lower depth and for arbitrary observables.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Partial Tidal Disruption Events by Intermediate-mass Black Holes in Supermassive and Intermediate-mass Black Hole Binaries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18812v1,"Xiao-Jun Wu, Ye-Fei Yuan, Yan Luo, Wenbin Lin","In the centers of galaxies, stars that orbit supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) can undergo tidal disruptions due to the Lidov-Kozai mechanism. Nevertheless, most previous researches have predominantly focused on full tidal disruption events (FTDEs). In this study, we employ N-body simulations to investigate partial tidal disruption events (PTDEs) induced by intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in SMBH-IMBH binaries, taking into account consideration the IMBH's mass, semi-major axis, and eccentricity of the outer orbit. Our findings indicate that, in comparison to FTDEs, the majority of tidal disruption events are actually PTDEs. Furthermore, we find that a significant number of stars experiencing partial disruption ultimately get captured by the IMBH, potentially leading to repeating flares. By comparing the period of the periodic eruptions observed in ASASSN-14ko, we find that PTDEs in a specific SMBH-IMBH binary system can align with the observed period if the SMBH has a mass of $10^7\rm{\ M_\odot}$, the IMBH has a mass smaller than approximately $10^5\rm{\ M_\odot}$, the eccentricity of the SMBH-IMBH binary exceeds approximately $0.5$, and the semi-major axis of the SMBH-IMBH binary is larger than approximately $0.001\rm{\ pc}$. Moreover, our model effectively accounts for the observed period derivative for ASASSN-14ko ($\dot{P}=-0.0026\pm 0.0006$), and our results also imply that some quasi-periodic eruptions may be attributed to PTDEs occurring around SMBH-IMBH binaries.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Physical Pathways for JWST-Observed Supermassive Black Holes in the Early Universe,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18773v1,"Junehyoung Jeon, Volker Bromm, Boyuan Liu, Steven L.

Some reside in overmassive systems with higher AGN to stellar mass ratios than locally. Understanding how massive black holes could form so early in cosmic history and affect their environment to establish the observed relations today are some of the major open questions in astrophysics and cosmology. One model to create these massive objects is through direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) that provide massive seeds ($\sim10^5-10^6$ M$_\odot$), able to reach high masses in the limited time available. We use the cosmological simulation code GIZMO to study the formation and growth of DCBH seeds in the early Universe. To grow the DCBHs, we implement a gas swallowing model that is set to match the Eddington accretion rate as long as the nearby gaseous environment, affected by stellar and accretion disk feedback, provides sufficient fuel. We find that to create massive AGN in overmassive systems at high redshifts, massive seeds accreting more efficiently than the fiducial Bondi-Hoyle model are needed. We assess whether the conditions for such enhanced accretion rates are realistic by considering limits on plausible transport mechanisms. We also examine various DCBH growth histories and find that mass growth is more sustained in overdense cosmological environments, where high gas densities are achieved locally. We discuss the exciting prospect to directly probe the assembly history of the first SMBHs with upcoming, ultra-deep JWST surveys.",{'black holes': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Conversely, when a particle starts the quantum walk from the lattice bulk, we observe the bulk walker being repelled from the edge, especially in the presence of strong hopping modulation. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum walk of two particles with nearest-neighbor interaction, emphasizing the repulsion between edge and bulk walkers caused by the interaction. Also, we explore the dynamics of two interacting particles in the lattice bulk and find interesting bulk localization through the formation of bound states influenced by the combined effect of hopping modulation and nearest-neighbor interaction.

Primordial black holes or else? Tidal tests on subsolar mass gravitational-wave observations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18656v1,"F. Crescimbeni, G. Franciolini, P. Pani, A. Riotto","The detection of a subsolar object in a compact binary merger is regarded as one of the smoking gun signatures of a population of primordial black holes (PBHs). We critically assess whether these systems could be distinguished from stellar binaries, for example composed of white dwarfs or neutron stars, which could also populate the subsolar mass range. At variance with PBHs, the gravitational-wave signal from stellar binaries is affected by tidal effects, which dramatically grow for moderately compact stars as those expected in the subsolar range. We forecast the capability of constraining tidal effects of putative subsolar neutron star binaries with current and future LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivities as well as next-generation experiments. We show that, should LVK O4 run observe subsolar neutron-star mergers, it could measure the (large) tidal effects with high significance. In particular, for subsolar neutron-star binaries, O4 and O5 projected sensitivities would allow measuring the effect of tidal disruption on the waveform in a large portion of the parameter space, also constraining the tidal deformability at ${\cal O}(10\%)$ level, thus excluding a primordial origin of the binary. Viceversa, for subsolar PBH binaries, model-agnostic upper bounds on the tidal deformability can rule out neutron stars or more exotic competitors. Assuming events similar to the sub-threshold candidate SSM200308 reported in LVK O3b data are PBH binaries, O4 projected sensitivity would allow ruling out the presence of neutron-star tidal effects at $\approx 3 σ$ C.L., thus strengthening the PBH hypothesis. Future experiments would lead to even stronger ($>5σ$) conclusions on potential discoveries of this kind.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

GN42437 has a low-metallicity (5-10% Z$_\odot$) and its rest-frame H$α$ equivalent width suggests nearly all of the observed stellar mass formed within the last 3 Myr. GN42437 has an extraordinary 7$σ$ significant [Ne V] 3427 $\mathring{\rm A}$ detection.

Ionization from massive stars, shocks, or high-mass X-ray binaries cannot simultaneously produce these [Ne V] and low-ionization line ratios. Reproducing the complete nebular structure requires both massive stars and accretion onto a black hole. We do not detect broad lines nor do the traditional diagnostics indicate that GN42437 has an accreting black hole. Thus, the very-high-ionization emission lines powerfully diagnose faint narrow-line black holes at high-redshift. We approximate the black hole mass in a variety of ways as log(M$_{\rm BH}/M_\odot) \sim 5-7$.

Negative Temperature Pressure in Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18570v1,Richard A.

For decades negative temperatures have been shown in a number of spin systems, but experiments only recently demonstrated atomic ensembles with negative temperatures in their motional degrees of freedom. An observed behavior of such negative temperature ensembles is that despite highly attractive forces between an arbitrary number of particles, there is a self-stabilization against collapse. Negative temperatures are only possible in quantum systems because there exists upper bounds on the energy of particles -- a property not found in classical physics. Here we consider whether event horizons set up similar upper limits within black holes, giving rise to negative temperature systems just within event horizons. Combining black hole thermodynamics with experimentally observed negative temperature effects could imply a quantum-based outward pressure in black holes.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the gold standard classical algorithm for predicting these properties, but relies on approximations of the unknown universal functional, limiting its general applicability for many fundamental and technologically relevant systems. In this work we develop a hybrid quantum/classical algorithm called quantum enhanced DFT (QEDFT) that systematically constructs quantum approximations of the universal functional using data obtained from a quantum computer.
  We benchmark the QEDFT algorithm on the Fermi-Hubbard model, both numerically and on data from experiments on real quantum hardware. We find that QEDFT surpasses the quality of groundstate results obtained from Hartree-Fock DFT, as well as from direct application of conventional quantum algorithms such as VQE. Furthermore, we demonstrate that QEDFT works even when only noisy, low-depth quantum computation is available, by benchmarking the algorithm on data obtained from Google's quantum computer.
  We further show how QEDFT also captures quintessential properties of strongly correlated Mott physics for large Fermi-Hubbard systems using functionals generated on much smaller system sizes. Our results indicate that QEDFT can be applied to realistic materials and molecular systems, and has the potential to outperform the direct application of either DFT or VQE alone, without the requirement of large scale or fully fault-tolerant quantum computers.",{'quantum computer': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

A linear photonic swap test circuit for quantum kernel estimation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17923v1,"Alessio Baldazzi, Nicolò Leone, Matteo Sanna, Stefano Azzini, Lorenzo Pavesi","Among supervised learning models, Support Vector Machine stands out as one of the most robust and efficient models for classifying data clusters. At the core of this method, a kernel function is employed to calculate the distance between different elements of the dataset, allowing for their classification. Since every kernel function can be expressed as a scalar product, we can estimate it using Quantum Mechanics, where probability amplitudes and scalar products are fundamental objects. The swap test, indeed, is a quantum algorithm capable of computing the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions, potentially enabling a quantum speed-up. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By utilizing 2$^3$ spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubits state and perform the swap test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve multi-qubits gates.

Wang, Yi-Zhuang You, Zlatko Minev, Susanne F. Yelin, Alireza Seif","Extracting information efficiently from quantum systems is a major component of quantum information processing tasks. Randomized measurements, or classical shadows, enable predicting many properties of arbitrary quantum states using few measurements. While random single qubit measurements are experimentally friendly and suitable for learning low-weight Pauli observables, they perform poorly for nonlocal observables. Prepending a shallow random quantum circuit before measurements maintains this experimental friendliness, but also has favorable sample complexities for observables beyond low-weight Paulis, including high-weight Paulis and global low-rank properties such as fidelity. However, in realistic scenarios, quantum noise accumulated with each additional layer of the shallow circuit biases the results. To address these challenges, we propose the robust shallow shadows protocol. Our protocol uses Bayesian inference to learn the experimentally relevant noise model and mitigate it in postprocessing. This mitigation introduces a bias-variance trade-off: correcting for noise-induced bias comes at the cost of a larger estimator variance. Despite this increased variance, as we demonstrate on a superconducting quantum processor, our protocol correctly recovers state properties such as expectation values, fidelity, and entanglement entropy, while maintaining a lower sample complexity compared to the random single qubit measurement scheme. We also theoretically analyze the effects of noise on sample complexity and show how the optimal choice of the shallow shadow depth varies with noise strength. This combined theoretical and experimental analysis positions the robust shallow shadow protocol as a scalable, robust, and sample-efficient protocol for characterizing quantum states on current quantum computing platforms.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Learning to Program Variational Quantum Circuits with Fast Weights,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17760v1,Samuel Yen-Chi Chen,"Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has surfaced as a pioneering framework addressing sequential control tasks and time-series modeling. It has demonstrated empirical quantum advantages notably within domains such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and time-series prediction. A significant advancement lies in Quantum Recurrent Neural Networks (QRNNs), specifically tailored for memory-intensive tasks encompassing partially observable environments and non-linear time-series prediction. Nevertheless, QRNN-based models encounter challenges, notably prolonged training duration stemming from the necessity to compute quantum gradients using backpropagation-through-time (BPTT). This predicament exacerbates when executing the complete model on quantum devices, primarily due to the substantial demand for circuit evaluation arising from the parameter-shift rule. This paper introduces the Quantum Fast Weight Programmers (QFWP) as a solution to the temporal or sequential learning challenge. The QFWP leverages a classical neural network (referred to as the 'slow programmer') functioning as a quantum programmer to swiftly modify the parameters of a variational quantum circuit (termed the 'fast programmer'). Instead of completely overwriting the fast programmer at each time-step, the slow programmer generates parameter changes or updates for the quantum circuit parameters. This approach enables the fast programmer to incorporate past observations or information. Notably, the proposed QFWP model achieves learning of temporal dependencies without necessitating the use of quantum recurrent neural networks. Numerical simulations conducted in this study showcase the efficacy of the proposed QFWP model in both time-series prediction and RL tasks. The model exhibits performance levels either comparable to or surpassing those achieved by QLSTM-based models.","{'quantum circuit': 2, 'quantum machine learning': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Bound-state confinement after trap-expansion dynamics in integrable systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17623v1,"Leonardo Biagetti, Vincenzo Alba","Integrable systems possess stable families of quasiparticles, which are composite objects (bound states) of elementary excitations. Motivated by recent quantum computer experiments, we investigate bound-state transport in the spin-$1/2$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain ($XXZ$ chain). Specifically, we consider the sudden vacuum expansion of a finite region $A$ prepared in a non-equilibrium state. In the hydrodynamic regime, if interactions are strong enough, bound states remain confined in the initial region. Bound-state confinement persists until the density of unbound excitations remains finite in the bulk of $A$. Since region $A$ is finite, at asymptotically long times bound states are ""liberated"" after the ""evaporation"" of all the unbound excitations. Fingerprints of confinement are visible in the space-time profiles of local spin-projection operators. To be specific, here we focus on the expansion of the $p$-Néel states, which are obtained by repetition of a unit cell with $p$ up spins followed by $p$ down spins. Upon increasing $p$, the bound-state content is enhanced. In the limit $p\to\infty$ one obtains the domain-wall initial state. We show that for $p<4$, only bound states with $n>p$ are confined at large chain anisotropy. For $p\gtrsim 4$, also bound states with $n=p$ are confined, consistent with the absence of transport in the limit $p\to\infty$. The scenario of bound-state confinement leads to a hierarchy of timescales at which bound states of different sizes are liberated, which is also reflected in the dynamics of the von Neumann entropy.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We evaluate the ability of this method by calculating the parameter estimation of simulated SLGW signals from massive binary black holes. We apply the Fisher information matrix and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to calculate parameter estimation. We find that with only one SLGW signal, the measurement precision of η0 can reach a considerable level of 0.5-1.3% for η1(z) and 1.1-2.6% for η2(z), depending on the lens model and parameters.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Time series generation for option pricing on quantum computers using tensor network,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.17148v1,"Nozomu Kobayashi, Yoshiyuki Suimon, Koichi Miyamoto","Finance, especially option pricing, is a promising industrial field that might benefit from quantum computing. While quantum algorithms for option pricing have been proposed, it is desired to devise more efficient implementations of costly operations in the algorithms, one of which is preparing a quantum state that encodes a probability distribution of the underlying asset price. In particular, in pricing a path-dependent option, we need to generate a state encoding a joint distribution of the underlying asset price at multiple time points, which is more demanding. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach using Matrix Product State (MPS) as a generative model for time series generation. To validate our approach, taking the Heston model as a target, we conduct numerical experiments to generate time series in the model. Our findings demonstrate the capability of the MPS model to generate paths in the Heston model, highlighting its potential for path-dependent option pricing on quantum computers.",{'matrix product state': 1},02.2024,2024,02,[]

Eccentric Mergers in AGN Discs: Influence of the Supermassive Black-Hole on Three-body Interactions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16948v1,"Gaia Fabj, Johan Samsing","There are indications that stellar-origin black holes (BHs) are efficiently paired up in binary black holes (BBHs) in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) disc environments, which can undergo interactions with single BHs in the disc. Such binary-single interactions can potentially lead to an exceptionally high fraction of gravitational-wave mergers with measurable eccentricity in LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA. We here take the next important step in this line of studies, by performing post-Newtonian N-body simulations between migrating BBHs and single BHs set in an AGN disc-like configuration with a consistent inclusion of the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the equations of motion. With this setup, we study how the fraction of eccentric mergers varies in terms of the initial size of the BBH semi-major axis relative to the Hill sphere, as well as how it depends on the angle between the BBH and the incoming single BH. We find that the fraction of eccentric mergers is still relatively large, even when the interactions are notably influenced by the gravitational field of the nearby SMBH. However, the fraction as a function of the BBH semi-major axis does not follow a smooth functional shape, but instead shows strongly varying features that originate from the underlying phase-space structure. The phase-space further reveals that many of the eccentric mergers are formed through prompt scatterings. Finally, we present the first analytical solution to how the presence of an SMBH in terms of its Hill sphere affects the probability for forming eccentric BBH mergers through chaotic three-body interactions.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In this article, we use a suite of 84 numerical-relativity simulations in 28 different physical setups to explore the impact of the individual stars' spin on the merger outcome and on the early postmerger dynamics. We find that for setups close to the prompt-collapse threshold, the stars' intrinsic spin significantly changes the lifespan of the remnant before collapse and that the mass of the debris disk surrounding the BH is also altered.

Depending on the source, the configuration of the field lines may differ significantly, affecting the trajectories of charged particles and the corresponding observables. Usually, the magnetic fields around black holes are modeled within a single source or current generating the field. However, magnetic fields can have more than a single origin, being a combination of different fields, such as, e.g., that of an accretion disk and external large-scale or Galactic ones. In this paper, we propose a combined magnetic field solution given by the superposition of the uniform and Blandford-Znajek split-monopole magnetic fields in a strong gravity regime of the Schwarzschild black hole. We show that when the combined magnetic field components are aligned, the resulting field is of a paraboloidal jetlike shape. Such a configuration is supported by relativistic jet observations and is often utilized in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations. In the opposite orientation of the two field components, we observe looplike field structures magnetically connecting the black hole with an accretion disk and the magnetic null points, which can be related to the regions of magnetic reconnection. In the combined magnetic field configurations, we analyze the dynamics of charged particles, study their stability conditions, and find the locations of stable off-equatorial structures close to the symmetry axis. We consider an ionization of Keplerian accretion disk as a particular scenario of particle scattering. From the numerical experiments, we conclude that charged particles in the jetlike combination show a strong tendency to escape from the black hole. In contrast, the looplike combination supports accretion of charged particles into the black hole.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Order $p$ quantum Wasserstein distances from couplings,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16477v1,"Emily Beatty, Daniel Stilck França","Optimal transport provides a powerful mathematical framework with applications spanning numerous fields. A cornerstone within this domain is the $p$-Wasserstein distance, which serves to quantify the cost of transporting one probability measure to another. While recent attempts have sought to extend this measure to the realm of quantum states, existing definitions often present certain limitations, such as not being faithful. In this work, we present a new definition of quantum Wasserstein distances. This definition, leveraging the coupling method and a metric applicable to pure states, draws inspiration from a property characterising the classical Wasserstein distance - its determination based on its value on point masses. Subject to certain continuity properties, our definition exhibits numerous attributes expected of an optimal quantum rendition of the Wasserstein distance. Notably, our approach seamlessly integrates metrics familiar to quantum information theory, such as the trace distance. Moreover, it provides an organic extension for metrics, like Nielsen's complexity metric, allowing their application to mixed states with a natural operational interpretation. Furthermore, we analyze this metric's attributes in the context of random quantum states and unveil phase transitions concerning the complexity of subsystems of random states.",{'quantum information theory': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Testing The Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in Short Haired Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16373v1,"Min Zhao, Meirong Tang, Zhaoyi Xu","The Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture is a hypothesis regarding the properties of event horizons and singularities during the formation of black holes, stating that singularities are always encompassed by the event horizons(TEH) of black holes, thus preventing naked singularities from affecting the causal structure of spacetime. In this paper, we explore the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture in the context of rotating hairy black holes, aiming to understand the impact of hairiness on the conjecture for Kerr black holes. We investigate whether TEH of rotating hairy black holes can be disrupted by incoming test particles and scalar fields. When test particles and scalar fields incident on the rotating hairy black hole are found. In extreme cases, when considering a second order approximation, if the parameter $κ$ (The parameter here is a function related to hair strength $κ(Q_m^{2k})$.)falls within the range of $0<κ<\sqrt{1/3}$, TEH of a hairy black hole can be disrupted. Conversely, in the range of $\sqrt{1/3}<κ<1$, TEH of a hairy black hole cannot be disrupted. When considering the second order approximation in near extreme cases, the parameter $κ$, within the range of $0<κ<1$, can lead to the disruption of TEH in this spacetime. When an incident scalar field is present, in near extreme conditions, TEH of a rotating short hair black hole cannot be disrupted. Therefore, the value of the parameter $κ$ reveals the connection between rotating short hair black holes and the weak cosmic censorship conjecture, indicating that the presence of short hair significantly affects TEH of black holes. This will aid in further understanding the nature of rotating short hair black holes.",{'black holes': 8},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Lower bound for large midpoint transversal fluctuations in the corner growth model,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16332v1,Xiao Shen,"The study of transversal fluctuation of the optimal path has been a crucial aspect of the KPZ universality class. In this paper, we establish the first probability lower bound, with optimal exponential order, for the rare event in which the midpoint (or any fixed level) of the geodesic has a large transversal fluctuation. We present our result in the setting of the corner growth model, which is also known as the exponential last-passage percolation. The previously known lower bounds hold for the maximum transversal fluctuation along the entire geodesic (Hammond-Sarkar'20) or the starting portion of the geodesic at a local scale (Agarwal'23). Our result improves upon these as now the rare event can demand where the large fluctuation occurs exactly along the geodesic, on both local and global scales. This fills the final missing piece in the literature on the tail bounds for the transversal fluctuation of geodesics. Our proof utilizes the coupling method: we first obtain a version of the estimate for the semi-infinite geodesic using duality and then transfer the result to finite geodesics using path monotonicity. Our method differs from the previous works (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20), and in fact, we do not require fine information about the left tail moderate deviation of the last-passage time, which played a crucial role in (Agarwal'23, Hammond-Sarkar'20).",{'geodesics': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In the case $β=1$ this is a question of long standing in the mathematical statistics literature. A recursive procedure to accomplish this task is given for $β$ a positive integer, and the parameter $λ_1$ a non-negative integer. This case is special due to a finite basis of elementary functions, with coefficients which are polynomials. In the Laguerre case with $β= 1$ and $λ_1 + 1/2$ a non-negative integer some evidence is given of their again being a finite basis, now consisting of elementary functions and the error function multiplied by elementary functions. Moreover, from this the corresponding distributions in the fixed trace case permit a finite basis of power functions, as also for $λ_1$ a non-negative integer. The fixed trace case in this setting is relevant to quantum information theory and quantum transport problem, allowing particularly the exact determination of Landauer conductance distributions in a previously intractable parameter regime.

In the quantum framework we analyse the properties of the Einstein-Vaz shells which are the final result of the quantum gravitational collapse arising from the Lemaitre Tolman Bondi discussed by Vaz in 2014. In fact, Vaz showed that continued collapse to a singularity can only be obtained if one combines two independent and entire solutions of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation. Forbidding such a combinatin leads naturally to matter condensing on the Schwarzschild surface during quantum collapse. In that way, an entirely new framework for black holes (BHs) has emerged.

The Stability of Gapped Quantum Matter and Error-Correction with Adiabatic Noise,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14906v1,"Ali Lavasani, Sagar Vijay","The codespace of a quantum error-correcting code can often be identified with the degenerate ground-space within a gapped phase of quantum matter. We argue that the stability of such a phase is directly related to a set of coherent error processes against which this quantum error-correcting code (QECC) is robust: such a quantum code can recover from adiabatic noise channels, corresponding to random adiabatic drift of code states through the phase, with asymptotically perfect fidelity in the thermodynamic limit, as long as this adiabatic evolution keeps states sufficiently ""close"" to the initial ground-space. We further argue that when specific decoders -- such as minimum-weight perfect matching -- are applied to recover this information, an error-correcting threshold is generically encountered within the gapped phase. In cases where the adiabatic evolution is known, we explicitly show examples in which quantum information can be recovered by using stabilizer measurements and Pauli feedback, even up to a phase boundary, though the resulting decoding transitions are in different universality classes from the optimal decoding transitions in the presence of incoherent Pauli noise. This provides examples where non-local, coherent noise effectively decoheres in the presence of syndrome measurements in a stabilizer QECC.",{'quantum error-correcting code': 2},02.2024,2024,02,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Specifically, suppose we have an operator that can be expressed as a concise sum of projectors whose expectation values we know a priori to be $O(ε)$. In that case, we can estimate the expectation value of the entire operator within error $ε$ using a number of quantum operations that scales as $O(1/\sqrtε)$. We then show how this can be used to reduce the cost of learning a potential energy surface in quantum chemistry applications by exploiting information gained from the energy at nearby points. Furthermore, we show, using Newton-Cotes methods, how these ideas can be exploited to learn the energy via integration of derivatives that we can estimate using a priori knowledge. This allows us to reduce the cost of energy estimation if the block-encodings of directional derivative operators have a smaller normalization constant than the Hamiltonian of the system.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
"Birth of Rapidly Spinning, Overmassive Black Holes in the Early Universe",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14706v1,"Kohei Inayoshi, Kohei Ichikawa","The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled numerous massive black holes (BHs) in faint, broad-line active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The discovery highlights the presence of dust-reddened AGN populations, referred to as little red dots (LRDs), more abundant than X-ray selected AGNs, which are less influenced by obscuration. This finding indicates that the cosmic growth rate of BHs within this population does not decrease but rather increases at higher redshifts beyond $z\sim 6$. The BH accretion rate density deduced from their luminosity function is remarkably higher than that from other AGN surveys in X-ray and infrared bands. To align the cumulative mass density accreted to BHs with the observed BH mass density at $z\simeq 4-5$, as derived from the integration of the BH mass function, the radiative efficiency must be doubled from the canonical 10% value, achieving significance beyond the $>2σ$ confidence level. This suggests the presence of rapid spins with 96% of the maximum limit among these BHs, maintained by prolonged mass accretion instead of chaotic accretion with randomly oriented inflows. Moreover, we derive an upper bound for the stellar mass of galaxies hosting these LRDs, ensuring consistency with galaxy formation in the standard cosmological model, where the host stellar mass is limited by the available baryonic reservoir. Our analysis gives a lower bound for the BH-to-galaxy mass ratio that exceeds the typical value known in the nearby universe and aligns with that for JWST-detected unobscured AGNs. Accordingly, we propose a hypothesis that the dense, dust-rich environments within LRDs facilitate the emergence of rapidly spinning and overmassive BH populations during the epoch of reionization. This scenario predicts a potential association between relativistic jets and other high-energy phenomena with overmassive BHs in the early universe.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Quantum computers offer a promising alternative for solving these equations, as they can simulate larger and more complex systems more efficiently both in time and resources. In this paper we investigate the potential of using the variational quantum imaginary time evolution (VarQITE) algorithm on near-term quantum hardware to solve for the Maxwells equations. Our objective is to analyze the trade-off between the accuracy of the simulated fields and the depth of the quantum circuit required to implement the VarQITE algorithm. We demonstrate that VarQITE can efficiently approximate the solution of these equations with high accuracy, and show that its performance can be enhanced by optimizing the quantum circuit depth.

Among 601 bright AGN with 0.2-5 keV counts of greater than 100, 83 sources (~14%) are classified as steep-spectrum sources. These sources have typical 0.5-2 keV luminosities of L(SX) ~ 1e44 erg/s and the majority of them are found at redshifts below z=1. In comparison with sources with flatter spectra, these sources have, on average, a UV (or optical) to 2 keV luminosity ratio that is larger by ~0.3 dex and bluer optical-to-UV continuum emission. They also appear to be radio quiet based on the detection rate in the FIRST and VLASS surveys. Their host galaxies -- at least in the redshift range of z=0.2-0.8, where the AGN-galaxy decomposition results from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam imaging are available -- tend to be late-type and have smaller stellar masses than those of sources with flatter spectra. These properties are similar to those found in nearby narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, in agreement with the picture that they are AGN with elevated accretion rates and are in the early growth phase of black hole and galaxy co-evolution. However, the steep-spectrum sources are not exclusively narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies; indeed many are broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies, as found by a catalogue search. This suggests that these steep-spectrum sources may be black holes generally with high accretion rates but of a wide mass range, including a few objects emitting at L(SX)>1e45 erg/s, of which black hole masses can be close to 10^9 M_sun.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
New Mass Window for Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter from Memory Burden Effect,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14069v1,"Ana Alexandre, Gia Dvali, Emmanouil Koutsangelas","The mass ranges allowed for Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) to constitute all of Dark Matter (DM) are broadly constrained. However, these constraints rely on the standard semiclassical approximation which assumes that the evaporation process is self-similar. Quantum effects such as memory burden take the evaporation process out of the semiclassical regime latest by half-decay time. What happens beyond this time is currently not known. However, theoretical evidence based on prototype models indicates that the evaporation slows down thereby extending the lifetime of a black hole. This modifies the mass ranges constrained, in particular, by BBN and CMB spectral distortions. We show that previous constraints are largely relaxed when the PBH lifetime is extended, making it possible for PBHs to constitute all of DM in previously excluded mass ranges. In particular, this is the case for PBHs lighter than $10^9$g which enter the memory burden stage before BBN and are still present today as DM.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In order to obtain the equation of state (EOS) of strange quark matter, we have employed a modified version of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model (MNJL) which includes a combination of NJL Lagrangian and its Fierz transformation by using weighting factors ($1-α$) and $α$. Additionally, we have also calculated dimensionless tidal deformability ($Λ$) in massive gravity. To constrain the allowed values of the parameters appearing in massive gravity, we have imposed the condition $Λ_{1.4 {M}_{\odot }}\lesssim580 $. Notably, in the MNJL model, the value of $α$ varies between zero and one. As $α$ increases, the EOS becomes stiffer, and the value of $Λ$ increases accordingy. We have demonstrated that by softening the EOS with increasing the bag constant, one can obtain objects in massive gravity that not only satisfy the constraint $Λ_{1.4 {M}% _{\odot }}\lesssim580$, but they also fall within the unknown mass gap region ($2.5{M}_{\odot}-5{M}_{\odot }$).

The amplification of the scalar power spectrum gives rise to scalar-induced gravitational waves and the generation of primordial black holes. The predicted stochastic gravitational wave background falls within the sensitivity range of existing and upcoming gravitational wave detectors, while primordial black holes hold the potential to explain the abundance of dark matter. Furthermore, we highlight the significance of the leading-order nonrenormalizable term in the superpotential of achieving inflationary observables consistent with the latest experimental data.

Our constructions incur a constant-factor increase in the quantum circuit depth and a polynomial overhead in the number of qubits: To execute an arbitrary quantum circuit on $n$ qubits, we give a 3D quantum fault-tolerance architecture involving $O(n^{3/2} \log^3 n)$ qubits, and a quasi-2D architecture using $O(n^2 \log^3 n)$ qubits. Applied to recent fault-tolerance constructions, this gives a fault-tolerance threshold theorem for universal quantum computations with local operations, a polynomial qubit overhead and a quasi-polylogarithmic depth overhead.

Radiating particle in the vicinity of the weakly charged Schwarzschild black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13797v1,"Bakhtinur Juraev, Zdeněk Stuchlík, Arman Tursunov, Martin Kološ","It is well known that supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies are capable of accelerating charged particles to very high energies. In many cases, the particle acceleration by black holes occurs electromagnetically through an electric field induced by the source. In such scenarios, the accelerated particles radiate electromagnetic waves, leading to the appearance of the backreaction force, which can considerably change the dynamics, especially, if the particles are relativistic. The effect of the radiation reaction force due to accelerating electric field of the central body in curved spacetime has not been considered previously. We study the dynamics of radiating charged particles in the field of the Schwarzschild black hole in the presence of an electric field associated with a small central charge of negligible gravitational influence. We start from the flat spacetime description, solving the Lorentz-Dirac equation reduced to the Landau-Lifshitz form. In curved spacetime, we use the DeWitt-Brehme equation and discuss the effect of the self-force, also known as the tail term, within the given approach. We also study the pure effect of the self-force to calculate the radiative deceleration of radially moving charged particles. In the case of bounded orbits, we find that the radiation reaction force can stabilize and circularize the orbits of oscillating charged particles by suppressing the oscillations or causing the particles to spiral down into the black hole depending on the sign of the electrostatic interaction. In all cases, we calculate the energy losses and exact trajectories of charged particles for different values and signs of electric charge.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Reinforcement learning-assisted quantum architecture search for variational quantum algorithms,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13754v3,Akash Kundu,"A significant hurdle in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era is identifying functional quantum circuits. These circuits must also adhere to the constraints imposed by current quantum hardware limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), a class of quantum-classical optimization algorithms, were developed to address these challenges in the currently available quantum devices. However, the overall performance of VQAs depends on the initialization strategy of the variational circuit, the structure of the circuit (also known as ansatz), and the configuration of the cost function. Focusing on the structure of the circuit, in this thesis, we improve the performance of VQAs by automating the search for an optimal structure for the variational circuits using reinforcement learning (RL). Within the thesis, the optimality of a circuit is determined by evaluating its depth, the overall count of gates and parameters, and its accuracy in solving the given problem. The task of automating the search for optimal quantum circuits is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). The majority of research in QAS is primarily focused on a noiseless scenario. Yet, the impact of noise on the QAS remains inadequately explored. In this thesis, we tackle the issue by introducing a tensor-based quantum circuit encoding, restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, a double deep Q-network (DDQN) with an $ε$-greedy policy for better stability. The numerical experiments on noiseless and noisy quantum hardware show that in dealing with various VQAs, our RL-based QAS outperforms existing QAS. Meanwhile, the methods we propose in the thesis can be readily adapted to address a wide range of other VQAs.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Then, it is not suitable to describe these systems with equilibrium thermodynamics corresponding to Gibbs-Boltzmann kinetic theory. In the present work, we investigate such thermal systems by using hydrostatic equilibrium thermodynamics. Assuming that the gas between the horizons obeys the Tsallis statistical mechanics, we found that it is possible to obtain the temperature gradient for the classical gas. Interestingly, the gas behaves as classical gas near the horizon and behaves like quantum gas around flat spacetime with constant temperature.

However, given the universality of the gravitational pull, it is expected that dark matter accumulates around astrophysical black holes, which can have an impact in the overall gravitational field, especially at galactic centers, and induce non-negligible effects in their observational imprints. In this work we study the optical appearance of a spherically symmetric black hole both when orbited by isotropically emitting light sources and when surrounded by a (geometrically and optically thin) accretion disk, while immersed in a dark matter halo. The black hole geometry plus the dark matter halo come as a solution of Einstein's field equations coupled to an anisotropic fluid whose density component follows a Hermquist-type distribution. Even in situations in which the geodesic description differs profoundly from the isolated black hole case, we find minor modifications to the primary and secondary tracks of the isotropic orbiting sources, and to the width, location, and relative luminosity of the corresponding photon rings as compared to the Schwarzschild black hole at equal black hole mass and emission models.

We also study the so-called weak integrability breaking, which occurs if the dynamical effects of the perturbation do not appear at leading order in the perturbing parameter. A recent statement in the literature claimed that integrability breaking should generally lead to an exponential growth of the AGP norm with respect to the volume. However, afterwards it was found that weak integrability breaking is a counter-example, leading to a cross-over between polynomial and exponential growth. Here we show that in free fermionic systems the AGP norm always grows polynomially, if the perturbation is local with respect to the fermions, even if the perturbation strongly breaks integrability.

We identify a specific regime of fugacities where our saddle point analysis is valid. It turns out that this condition ensures the absence of closed-time-like curves and the stability of dual black hole solutions with equal charges. In addition, the giant graviton expansion of the index provides insights into how small black holes in AdS can be interpreted as bound states of branes.

Several indirect tracers have been explored in the literature, including X/S-shaped radio morphologies and double-peaked (DP) emission lines in the optical spectra. However, the detection rates of confirmed dual AGN candidates from the individual methods remain extremely small. We search for binary black holes in a sample of six sources that exhibit both X-shaped radio morphology and DP emission lines using the VLBA.

In addition, we present deep uGMRT images revealing the exquisite details of the X-shaped wings in three sources. We present a detailed precession modeling analysis of these sources. The BH separations estimated from the simplistic geodetic precession model are incompatible with those estimated from emission line offsets and the VLBA separations.

Analytic Electrically Charged Black Holes in $F(R)$-ModMax Theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12492v2,Behzad Eslam Panah,"Motivated by a new model of nonlinear electrodynamics known as Modified Maxwell (ModMax) theory, an exact analytical solution for black holes is obtained by coupling ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics and $F(R)$ gravity. Then, the effects of the system's parameters ($F(R)$-ModMax gravity parameters) on the event horizons are analyzed. The obtained black holes thermodynamic properties in the $F(R)$-ModMax theory are investigated by extracting their thermodynamic quantities such as Hawking temperature, electric charge, electric potential, entropy, and also total mass. The first law of thermodynamics for the system under study is evaluated. Next, by considering these black holes, the impact of various parameters on both the local stability and global stability are investigated by examining the heat capacity and the Helmholtz free energy, respectively. Finally, the thermodynamic geometry of the black hole in $F(R)$-ModMax gravity is investigated by applying the thermodynamic metric (the HPEM metric).",{'black holes': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Accretion discs onto supermassive compact objects: a portal to dark matter physics in active galaxies,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12491v1,"C. Millauro, C. R. Argüelles, F. L. Vieyro, V. Crespi, M. F. Mestre","The study of the physics of accretion discs developed around the supermassive black hole (BH) candidates are essential theoretical tools to test their nature. Here, we study the accretion flow and associated emission using generalised $α$-discs on to horizonless dark compact objects, in order to compare with the traditional BH scenario. The BH alternative here proposed consists in a dense and highly degenerate core made of fermionic dark matter (DM) which is surrounded by a more diluted DM halo. Such a dense core -- diluted halo DM configuration is a solution of the Einstein equations of General Relativity (GR) in spherical symmetry, which naturally arises once the quantum nature of the DM fermions is dully accounted for. The methodology followed in this work consist in first generalising the theory of $α$-discs to work in the presence of regular and horizonless compact objects, and second, to apply it to the case of core-halo DM profiles typical of active-like galaxies. The fact that the compactness of the dense and transparent DM core scales with the particle mass, allows for the following key findings of this work: (i) it always exist a given core compacity -- i.e., corresponding particle mass -- which produces a luminosity spectrum which is basically indistinguishable from that of a Schwarzschild BH of the same mass as the DM core; (ii) the disc can enter deep inside the non-rotating DM core, allowing for accretion powered efficiencies as high as $28\%$, thus comparable to that of a highly rotating Kerr BH. These results, together with the existence of a critical DM core mass of collapse into a supermassive BH, open new avenues of research for two seemingly unrelated topics such as AGN phenomenology and dark matter physics.",{'einstein equations': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Specifically, by considering the gravitational theory of Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics coupled to a dilaton field with specific coupling functions, we perform an extensive analysis of the characteristics of the black hole, including its geodesics for massive particles, the energy conditions, thermodynamical and stability analysis. The inclusion of a dilaton scalar potential in the action can also give rise to asymptotically (A)dS spacetimes and an effective cosmological constant. Moreover, we find that the black hole can be thermodynamically favored when compared to the Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GMGHS) black hole for those parameters of the model that lead to a larger black-hole horizon for the same mass. Finally, it is observed that the energy conditions of the obtained black hole are indeed satisfied, further validating the robustness of the solution within the theoretical framework, but also implying that this self-gravitating dilaton-non-linear-electrodynamics system constitutes another explicit example of bypassing modern versions of the no-hair theorem without any violation of the energy conditions.",{'geodesics': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Sharpe, L. A. C. van Son, S. E. de Mink, R. Farmer, P. Marchant, G. Koenigsberger","Chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE) is a promising channel for forming massive binary black holes. The enigmatic, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) binary HD 5980 A&B has been proposed to have formed through this channel. We investigate this claim by comparing its observed parameters with CHE models. Using MESA, we simulate grids of close massive binaries then use a Bayesian approach to compare them with the stars' observed orbital period, masses, luminosities, and hydrogen surface abundances. The most probable models, given the observational data, have initial periods ~3 days, widening to the present-day ~20 day orbit as a result of mass loss -- correspondingly, they have very high initial stellar masses ($\gtrsim$150 M$_\odot$). We explore variations in stellar wind-mass loss and internal mixing efficiency, and find that models assuming enhanced mass-loss are greatly favored to explain HD 5980, while enhanced mixing is only slightly favoured over our fiducial assumptions. Our most probable models slightly underpredict the hydrogen surface abundances. Regardless of its prior history, this system is a likely binary black hole progenitor. We model its further evolution under our fiducial and enhanced wind assumptions, finding that both stars produce black holes with masses ~19-37 M$_\odot$. The projected final orbit is too wide to merge within a Hubble time through gravitational waves alone. However, the system is thought to be part of a 2+2 hierarchical multiple. We speculate that secular effects with the (possible) third and fourth companions may drive the system to promptly become a gravitational-wave source.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

This gives a new perspective on several applications of symmetries, but fails to capture continuous non-Abelian symmetries. The main aim of this work is to fill this gap. Guided by geometric engineering and holography, we recover various known features of representation theory of the non-Abelian symmetry from a SymTFT viewpoint.

Post-Minkowskian Theory Meets the Spinning Effective-One-Body Approach for Two-Body Scattering,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12342v1,"Alessandra Buonanno, Gustav Uhre Jakobsen, Gustav Mogull","Effective-one-body (EOB) waveforms employed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration have primarily been developed by resumming the post-Newtonian expansion of the relativistic two-body problem. Given the recent significant advancements in post-Minkowskian (PM) theory and gravitational self-force formalism, there is considerable interest in creating waveform models that integrate information from various perturbative methods in innovative ways. This becomes particularly crucial when tackling the accuracy challenge posed by upcoming ground-based detectors (such as the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and space-based detectors (such as LISA, TianQin or Taiji) expected to operate in the next decade. In this context, we present the derivation of the first spinning EOB Hamiltonian that incorporates PM results up to three-loop order: the SEOB-PM model. The model accounts for the complete hyperbolic motion, encompassing nonlocal-in-time tails. To evaluate its accuracy, we compare its predictions for the conservative scattering angle, augmented with dissipative contributions, against numerical-relativity data of non-spinning and spinning equal-mass black holes. We observe very good agreement, comparable, and in some cases slightly better to the recently proposed $w_{\rm EOB}$-potential model, of which the SEOB-PM model is a resummation around the probe limit. Indeed, in the probe limit, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian and scattering angles reduce to the one of a test mass in Kerr spacetime. Once complemented with nonlocal-in-time contributions for bound orbits, the SEOB-PM Hamiltonian can be utilized to generate waveform models for spinning black holes on quasi-circular orbits.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The training of parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) remains a significant practical challenge, exacerbated by the requirement of shallow circuit depth necessary for their hardware implementation. Hybrid methods employing classical computers alongside quantum devices, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), have proven useful for analyzing the capabilities of NISQ devices to solve relevant optimization problems. Still, in the simulation of complex structures involving the many-body problem in quantum mechanics, major issues remain about the representation of the system and obtaining results which clearly outperform classical computational devices. In this research contribution we propose the use of parameterized Tensor Networks (TNs) to attempt an improved performance of the VQE algorithm. A joint approach is presented where the Hamiltonian of a system is encapsulated into a Matrix Product Operator (MPO) within a parameterized unitary TN hereby splitting up the optimization task between the TN and the VQE.

We demonstrate that, even though the total polarization vanishes upon averaging over the photoelectron momentum, momentum-resolved spin polarization is significant, typically exhibiting a vortex structure relative to the laser polarization axis. The polarization arises from the transfer of spin-orbital coupling in the bound state to the spin-correlated quantum orbits in the continuum. The rescattering of photoelectrons at the atomic core plays an important role in forming the polarization vortex structure, while there is no significant effect of the spin-orbit coupling during the continuum dynamics.

Combining data in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) G23 region from GAMA, Evolutionary Map of the Universe (EMU) early science observations, and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we compare this technique with a selection of different AGN diagnostics to explore the similarities and differences in AGN classification. We find that diagnostics based on optical and near-infrared criteria (the standard BPT diagram, the WISE colour criterion, and the mass-excitation, or MEx diagram) tend to favour detection of AGN in high mass, high luminosity systems, while the ``ProSpect'' SED fitting tool can identify AGN efficiently in low mass systems. We investigate an explanation for this result in the context of proportionally lower mass black holes in lower mass galaxies compared to higher mass galaxies and differing proportions of emission from AGN and star formation dominating the light at optical and infrared wavelengths as a function of galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that SED-derived AGN classification is an efficient approach to identify low mass hosts with low radio luminosity AGN.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

While it has been shown that the proximity zone sizes correlate with the quasars' lifetimes due to the finite response time of the intergalactic medium to the quasars' radiation, we do not find any correlation between the proximity zone sizes and the black hole mass, which suggests that quasar activity and the concomitant black hole growth are intermittent and episodic.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Although noise and architectural variability can provide up to $\sim16\%$ output obfuscation, our comprehensive analysis revealed that models cloned under noisy conditions tend to be resilient, suffering little to no performance degradation due to such obfuscations.

MITS: A Quantum Sorcerer Stone For Designing Surface Codes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11027v2,"Avimita Chatterjee, Debarshi Kundu, Swaroop Ghosh","In the evolving landscape of quantum computing, determining the most efficient parameters for Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is paramount. Various quantum computers possess varied types and amounts of physical noise. Traditionally, simulators operate in a forward paradigm, taking parameters such as distance, rounds, and physical error to output a logical error rate. However, usage of maximum distance and rounds of the surface code might waste resources. An approach that relies on trial and error to fine-tune QEC code parameters using simulation tools like STIM can be exceedingly time-consuming. Additionally, daily fluctuations in quantum error rates can alter the ideal QEC settings needed. As a result, there is a crucial need for an automated solution that can rapidly determine the appropriate QEC parameters tailored to the current conditions. To bridge this gap, we present MITS, a tool designed to reverse-engineer the well-known simulator STIM for designing QEC codes. MITS accepts the specific noise model of a quantum computer and a target logical error rate as input and outputs the optimal surface code rounds and code distances. This guarantees minimal qubit and gate usage, harmonizing the desired logical error rate with the existing hardware limitations on qubit numbers and gate fidelity.

Comerford, Daniel Stern","Hyper-luminous X-ray sources (HLXs) are extragalactic off-nuclear X-ray sources with luminosities exceeding the theoretical limit for accretion onto stellar-mass compact objects. Many HLXs may represent intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) deposited in galaxy halos through mergers, and properties of the stellar cores surrounding HLXs provide powerful constraints on this scenario. Therefore, we have systematically built the largest sample of HLX candidates with archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging (24) for the first uniform population study of HLX stellar cores down to low masses. Based on their host galaxy redshifts, at least 21 (88%) have stellar core masses >=10^7 Msun and hence are consistent with accretion onto massive black holes from external galaxies. In 50% of the sample, the HST imaging reveals features connecting the HLXs with their host galaxies, strongly suggesting against the background/foreground contaminant possibility in these cases. Assuming a mass scaling relation for active galactic nuclei and accounting for an estimated contamination fraction of 29%, up to ~60% of our sample may be associated with IMBHs. Similar to previously known HLXs, the X-ray luminosities are systematically elevated relative to their stellar core masses, possibly from merger-driven accretion rate enhancements. The least massive stellar cores are preferentially found at larger nuclear offsets and are more likely to remain wandering in their host galaxy halos. The HLX galaxy occupation fraction is ~10^-2 and has a strong inverse mass dependence.

Holographic phenomenology via overlapping degrees of freedom,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.11016v3,"Oliver Friedrich, ChunJun Cao, Sean M. Carroll, Gong Cheng, Ashmeet Singh","The holographic principle suggests that regions of space contain fewer physical degrees of freedom than would be implied by conventional quantum field theory. Meanwhile, in Hilbert spaces of large dimension $2^n$, it is possible to define $N \gg n$ Pauli algebras that are nearly anti-commuting (but not quite) and which can be thought of as ""overlapping degrees of freedom"". We propose to model the phenomenology of holographic theories by allowing field-theory modes to be overlapping, and derive potential observational consequences. In particular, we build a Fermionic quantum field whose effective degrees of freedom approximately obey area scaling and satisfy a cosmic Bekenstein bound, and compare predictions of that model to cosmic neutrino observations. Our implementation of holography implies a finite lifetime of plane waves, which depends on the overall UV cutoff of the theory. To allow for neutrino flux from blazar TXS 0506+056 to be observable, our model needs to have a cutoff $k_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim 500\, k_{\mathrm{LHC}}\,$. This is broadly consistent with current bounds on the energy spectrum of cosmic neutrinos from IceCube, but high energy neutrinos are a potential challenge for our model of holography. We motivate our construction via quantum mereology, i.e. using the idea that EFT degrees of freedom should emerge from an abstract theory of quantum gravity by finding quasi-classical Hilbert space decompositions. We also discuss how to extend the framework to Bosons. Finally, using results from random matrix theory we derive an analytical understanding of the energy spectrum of our theory.

Investigating black hole accretion disks as potential polluter sources for the formation of enriched stars in globular clusters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10590v1,"Laurane Fréour, Alice Zocchi, Glenn van de Ven, Elena Pancino","Accretion disks surrounding stellar mass black holes (BHs) have been suggested as potential locations for the nucleosynthesis of light elements, which are our primary observational discriminant of multiple stellar populations within globular clusters. The population of enriched stars in globular clusters are enhanced in N14, Na23, and sometimes in Al27 and/or in K39. In this study, our aim is to investigate the feasibility of initiating nucleosynthesis for these four elements in BH accretion disks, considering various internal parameters such as the temperature of the gas and timescale of the accretion. To achieve this, we employed a 132-species reaction network. We used the slim disk model, suitable for the Super-Eddington mass accretion rate and for geometrically and optically thick disks. We explored the conditions related to the mass, mass accretion rate, viscosity, and radius of the BH-accretion disk system that would allow for the creation of N14, Na23, Al27, and K39 before the gas is accreted onto the central object. Our findings reveal that there is no region in the parameter space where the formation of Na23 can occur and only a very limited region where the formation of N14, Al27, and K39 is plausible. Specifically, this occurs for BHs with masses lower than 10 solar masses, with a preference toward even lower mass values and extremely low viscosity parameters ($α<10^{-3}$). Such values are highly unlikely based on current observations of stellar mass BHs. However, such low mass BHs could actually exist in the early universe, as so-called primordial BHs. In conclusion, our study suggests that the nucleosynthesis within BH accretion disks of four elements of interest for the multiple stellar populations is improbable, but not impossible, using the slim disk model.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
A Comparative Analysis of Hybrid-Quantum Classical Neural Networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10540v1,"Kamila Zaman, Tasnim Ahmed, Muhammad Abdullah Hanif, Alberto Marchisio, Muhammad Shafique","Hybrid Quantum-Classical Machine Learning (ML) is an emerging field, amalgamating the strengths of both classical neural networks and quantum variational circuits on the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. This paper performs an extensive comparative analysis between different hybrid quantum-classical machine learning algorithms, namely Quantum Convolution Neural Network, Quanvolutional Neural Network and Quantum ResNet, for image classification. The experiments designed in this paper focus on different Quantum ML (QML) algorithms to better understand the accuracy variation across the different quantum architectures by implementing interchangeable quantum circuit layers, varying the repetition of such layers and their efficient placement. Such variations enable us to compare the accuracy across different architectural permutations of a given hybrid QML algorithm.

Young, John A. Tomsick, Benjamin M. Coughenour, Menglei Zhou","We present the results from the NICER observation data of MAXI J1803-298 across the entire 2021 outburst. In the intermediate and soft state, we detect significant absorption lines at $\sim 7.0$ keV and $\sim 6.7$ keV, arising from the X-ray disk wind outflowing with a velocity of hundreds of km per second along our line of sight. The fitting results from photoionized model suggest that the wind is driven by thermal pressure and the mass-loss rate is low. We find a clear transition for iron from predominantly H-like to predominantly He-like during the intermediate-to-soft state transition. Our results indicate this transition for iron is caused by the evolution of the illuminating spectrum and the slow change of the geometric properties of the disk wind together. The coexistence of disk wind and QPOs features in intermediate state is also reported. Our study makes MAXI J1803-298 the first source in which a transition from optical wind to X-ray wind is detected, offering new insights into the evolution of disk winds across an entire outburst and long-term coupling of accretion disks and mass outflows around accreting black holes.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Extremal black hole formation as a critical phenomenon,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10190v1,"Christoph Kehle, Ryan Unger","In this paper, we prove that extremal black holes arise on the threshold of gravitational collapse. More precisely, we construct smooth one-parameter families of smooth, spherically symmetric solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-Vlasov system which interpolate between dispersion and collapse and for which the critical solution is an extremal black hole. Physically, these solutions can be understood as beams of gravitationally self-interacting collisionless charged particles fired into Minkowski space from past infinity. Depending on the precise value of the parameter, we show that the Vlasov matter either disperses due to the combined effects of angular momentum and electromagnetic repulsion, or undergoes gravitational collapse. At the critical value of the parameter, an extremal Reissner-Nordström black hole is formed. No naked singularities occur as the extremal threshold is crossed. We call this critical phenomenon extremal critical collapse and the present work constitutes the first rigorous result on the black hole formation threshold in general relativity.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Semi-classical dilaton gravity and the very blunt defect expansion,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10162v1,"Jorrit Kruthoff, Adam Levine","We explore dilaton gravity with general dilaton potentials in the semi-classical limit viewed both as a gas of blunt defects and also as a semi-classical theory in its own right. We compare the exact defect gas picture with that obtained by naively canonically quantizing the theory in geodesic gauge. We find a subtlety in the canonical approach due to a non-perturbative ambiguity in geodesic gauge. Unlike in JT gravity, this ambiguity arises already at the disk level. This leads to a distinct mechanism from that in JT gravity by which the semi-classical approximation breaks down at low temperatures. Along the way, we propose that new, previously un-studied saddles contribute to the density of states of dilaton gravity. This in particular leads to a re-interpretation of the disk-level density of states in JT gravity in terms of two saddles with fixed energy boundary conditions: the disk, which caps off on the outer horizon, and another, sub-leading complex saddle which caps off on the inner horizon. When the theory is studied using a defect expansion, we show how the smooth classical geometries of dilaton gravity arise from a dense gas of very blunt defects in the $G_N \to 0$ limit. The classical saddle points arise from a balance between the attractive force on the defects toward negative dilaton and a statistical pressure from the entropy of the configuration. We end with speculations on the nature of the space-like singularity present inside black holes described by certain dilaton potentials.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Gauge-Independent Metric Reconstruction of Perturbations of Vacuum Spherically-Symmetric Spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10004v1,"Michele Lenzi, Carlos F. Sopuerta","Perturbation theory of vacuum spherically-symmetric spacetimes (including the cosmological constant) has greatly contributed to the understanding of black holes, relativistic compact stars and even inhomogeneous cosmological models. The perturbative equations can be decoupled in terms of (gauge-invariant) master functions satisfying $1+1$ wave equations. In this work, building on previous work on the structure of the space of master functions and equations, we study the reconstruction of the metric perturbations in terms of the master functions. To that end, we consider the general situation in which the perturbations are driven by an arbitrary energy-momentum tensor. Then, we perform the metric reconstruction in a completely general perturbative gauge. In doing so, we investigate the role of Darboux transformations and Darboux covariance, responsible for the isospectrality between odd and even parity in the absence of matter sources and also of the physical equivalence between the descriptions based on all the possible master equations. We also show that the metric reconstruction can be carried out in terms of any of the possible master functions and that the expressions admit an explicitly covariant form.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Effective yields as tracers of feedback effects on metallicity scaling relations in the EAGLE cosmological simulations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09904v1,"M. C. Zerbo, M. E. De Rossi, M. A. Lara-López, S. A. Cora, L. J. Zenocratti","Effective yields, $y_{\rm eff}$, are defined by fundamental galaxy properties (i.e., stellar mass -$M_{\star}$-, gas mass -$M_{\rm gas}$- and gas-phase metallicity). For a closed-box model, $y_{\rm eff}$ is constant and equivalent to the mass in metals returned to the gas per unit mass locked in long-lived stars. Deviations from such behaviour have been often considered observational signatures of past feedback events. By analysing EAGLE simulations with different feedback models, we evaluate the impact of supernovae (SN) and active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on $y_{\rm eff}$ at redshift $z=0$. When removing supermassive black holes (BH) and, hence, AGN effects, in simulations, galaxies are located around a plane in the $M_{\star} - M_{\rm gas} - {\rm O/H}$ parameter space (being O/H a proxy for gas metallicity, as usual), with such a plane roughly describing a surface of constant $y_{\rm eff}$. As the ratio between BH mass and $M_{\star}$ increases, galaxies deviate from that plane towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$ as a consequence of AGN feedback. For galaxies not strongly affected by AGN feedback, a stronger SN feedback efficiency generates deviations towards lower $y_{\rm eff}$, while galaxies move towards the opposite side of the plane (i.e., towards higher values of $y_{\rm eff}$) as SN feedback becomes weaker. Star-forming galaxies observed in the Local Universe are located around a similar 3D plane. Our results suggest that the features of the scatter around the observed plane are related to the different feedback histories of galaxies, which might be traced by $y_{\rm eff}$.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Lorentz violation induces isospectrality breaking in Einstein-Bumblebee gravity theory,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09686v2,"Wentao Liu, Xiongjun Fang, Jiliang Jing, Jieci Wang","In this paper, we investigate the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a Lorentz-violating spacetime, factoring in a cosmological constant, within the framework of Einstein-Bumblebee gravity. Our findings reveal that the interaction of spacetime with an anisotropic bumblebee field imparts distinct contributions to the axial and polar sectors of the vector perturbations. This subsequently breaks the isospectrality typically observed in vector modes. Numerical evidence strongly indicates isospectral breaking in the vector modes of Einstein-Bumblebee black holes: a pronounced breakage in the real part of the frequencies, while the imaginary component seems less affected. This isospectral breaking indicates the existence of two different waveforms in the Ringdown phase of the black hole, which provides a potential signal of quantum gravity observable in current experiments.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Identifying the hosts of binary black hole and neutron star-black hole mergers with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09684v1,"Geoffrey Mo, Hsin-Yu Chen","The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration has detected over one hundred compact binary mergers in gravitational waves, but the formation history of these binaries remains an open question. Finding the host galaxies of these mergers will provide critical information that reveals how these binaries were formed. However, without an electromagnetic counterpart, localizing gravitational wave events to their hosts is challenging with the current generation of gravitational wave detectors. Next-generation detectors will localize some compact binary mergers to a small volume that allows for direct association with their hosts. To demonstrate the promise these detectors hold, we simulate a population of binary black hole and neutron star-black hole mergers using a next-generation gravitational wave network comprised of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope. We find that ~4% of binary black hole events within a redshift of 0.5 and ~3% of neutron star-black hole events within a redshift of 0.3 will be localized to a volume smaller than 100 Mpc^3, the volume in which we expect only one likely host galaxy. With the astrophysical merger rate estimated from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration's third observing run, we expect to precisely localize one binary black hole event every eight days and one neutron star-black hole event every 1.5 months. With three years of gravitational wave observations (O(100) binary black hole mergers with host associations), we will be able to distinguish whether binary black hole host galaxies trace stellar mass or star formation rate, constraining the delay time distribution and shedding light on the formation channels of binary black holes.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The derivation utilizes the scaled continuous matrix product state representation that maps the time evolution of quantum continuous measurement to the time evolution of the system and field. Specifically, we consider the Maccone-Pati uncertainty relation, a refinement of the Robertson uncertainty relation, to derive thermodynamic uncertainty relations and quantum speed limits within open quantum dynamics scenarios. These newly derived relations, which use a state orthogonal to the initial state, yield tighter bounds than the previously known bounds.

The impact of anisotropic sky-sampling on the Hubble constant in numerical relativity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09659v1,Hayley J. Macpherson,"We study the impact of nearby inhomogeneities on an observer's inference of the Hubble constant. Large-scale structures induce a dependence of cosmological parameters on observer position as well as an anisotropic variance of those parameters across an observer's sky. While the former has been explored quite thoroughly, the latter has not. Incomplete sampling of an anisotropic sky could introduce a bias in our cosmological inference if we assume an isotropic expansion law. In this work, we use numerical relativity simulations of large-scale structure combined with ray tracing to produce synthetic catalogs mimicking the low-redshift Pantheon supernova dataset. Our data contains all general-relativistic contributions to fluctuations in the distances and redshifts along geodesics in the simulation. We use these synthetic observations to constrain $H_0$ for a set of randomly-positioned observers. We study both the dependence on observer position as well as the impact of rotating the sample of supernovae on the observer's sky. We find a 1--2\% variance in $H_0$ between observers when they use an isotropic sample of objects. However, we find the inferred value of $H_0$ can vary by up to 4--6\% when observers simply rotate their Pantheon data set on the sky. While the variances we find are below the level of the ``Hubble tension'', our results may suggest a reduction in the significance of the tension if anisotropy of expansion can be correctly accounted for.",{'geodesics': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Guided Quantum Compression for Higgs Identification,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09524v1,"Vasilis Belis, Patrick Odagiu, Michele Grossi, Florentin Reiter, Günther Dissertori, Sofia Vallecorsa","Quantum machine learning provides a fundamentally novel and promising approach to analyzing data. However, many data sets are too complex for currently available quantum computers. Consequently, quantum machine learning applications conventionally resort to dimensionality reduction algorithms, e.g., auto-encoders, before passing data through the quantum models. We show that using a classical auto-encoder as an independent preprocessing step can significantly decrease the classification performance of a quantum machine learning algorithm. To ameliorate this issue, we design an architecture that unifies the preprocessing and quantum classification algorithms into a single trainable model: the guided quantum compression model. The utility of this model is demonstrated by using it to identify the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at the LHC, where the conventional approach proves ineffective. Conversely, the guided quantum compression model excels at solving this classification problem, achieving a good accuracy. Additionally, the model developed herein shows better performance compared to the classical benchmark when using only low-level kinematic features.",{'quantum machine learning': 3},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Mass Beyond Measure: Eccentric Searches for Black Hole Populations,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09513v1,"Nicholas DePorzio, Lisa Randall, Zhong-Zhi Xianyu","Stellar mass binary black holes of unknown formation mechanism have been observed, motivating new methods for distinguishing distinct black hole populations. This work explores how the orbital eccentricity of stellar mass binary black holes is a viable conduit for making such distinctions. Four different production mechanisms, and their corresponding eccentricity distributions, are studied in the context of an experimental landscape composed of mHz (LISA), dHz (DECIGO), and Hz (LIGO) range gravitational wave detectors. We expand on prior work considering these effects at fixed population eccentricity. We show that a strong signal corresponding to subsets of eccentric populations is effectively hidden from the mHz and dHz range gravitational wave detectors without the incorporation of high eccentricity waveform templates. Even with sufficiently large eccentricity templates, we find dHz range experiments with a LISA-like level of sensitivity are unlikely to aid in distinguishing different populations. We consider the degree to which a mHz range detector like LISA can differentiate among black hole populations independently and in concert with follow-up merger detection for binaries coalescing within a 10 year period. We find that mHz range detectors, with only $e < 0.01$ (nearly circular) sensitivity, can successfully discern eccentric sub-populations except when attempting to distinguish very low eccentricity distributions. In these cases where $e < 0.01$ sensitivity is insufficient, we find that the increase in event counts resulting from $e < 0.1$ sensitivity provides a statistically significant signal for discerning even these low eccentricity sub-populations. While improvements offered by $e<0.1$ sensitivity can be generally increased by $\mathcal{O}(1)$ factors with $e<0.4$ sensitivity, going beyond this in eccentricity sensitivity provides negligible enhancement.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In the noninteracting case, quantized Thouless pumps can only occur when a topological singularity is encircled adiabatically. In contrast, here we show that, in the presence of interactions, such topological transport can even persist for exotic paths in which the system gets arbitrarily close to the singularity. We illustrate the robustness of these exotic Thouless pumps through the behavior of the noninteracting singularity, which for sufficiently strong interactions splits into two singularities separated by a spontaneous antiferromagnetic insulator. We perform a numerical benchmark of these phenomena by means of tensor network simulations of ground-state physics and real-time adiabatic dynamics.

Dynamical 4-D Gauss-Bonnet action from matter-graviton interaction at one-loop,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08965v1,"Susobhan Mandal, S. Shankaranarayanan","The occurrence of singularities at the centers of black holes suggests that general relativity (GR), although a highly successful model of gravity and cosmology, is inapplicable. This is due to the breakdown of the equivalence principle. Gauss-Bonnet (GB) action is a simplest extension of GR as it possess second-order equations of motion and is devoid of ghosts. However, in 4-D, the GB action is topological. Recently, Glavan and Lin proposed a mathematical framework that transforms the 4-D GB gravity theory into a non-topological one. However, it has been argued that without a canonical way to choose 4-D from the higher-dimensional space, such a GB gravity is not well-defined in 4-D. The current work takes a step in addressing this issue by demonstrating that the rescaling of the GB coupling $α\rightarrow α/(D - 4)$ arises from the self-energy correction of gravitons in 4-D via \emph{the dimensional regularization}. To keep things transparent, we focus on the linearized theory of gravity coupled with matter fields. By computing the one-loop self-energy correction of gravitons induced by the matter fields, we explicitly provide the origin of the prescription provided by Glavan and Lin.

The population of radio-luminous quasars is of particular interest, as such quasars could potentially be used to study the neutral intergalactic medium during cosmic reionisation via H$\,$I 21$\,$cm absorption studies. However, the lack of deep radio observations of $z>6$ quasars leaves the population poorly constrained, and suitable candidates for an H$\,$I 21$\,$cm absorption study have yet to be found. In this work, we present Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) 1$-$2 GHz radio continuum observations of 138 quasars at redshifts $6.0 \leq z<7.6$. We detect the radio continuum emission of the $z=6.1$ quasar J1034-1425, with a 1.6 GHz flux density of $170\pm 36\,μ$Jy.

The Nature and Evolution of Early Massive Quenched Galaxies in the Simba-C Simulation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08729v1,"Jakub Szpila, Romeel Davé, Douglas Rennehan, Weiguang Cui, Renier Hough","We examine the nature, origin, and fate of early ($z\geq 2$) massive ($M_\star>10^{10}M_\odot$) quenched galaxies (EQGs) in a new $(100h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}^3)$ run of the Simba-C galaxy formation model. We define ``quenched'' to be $>4σ$ below an iterative polynomial fit to the star-forming sequence (SFS), and find that Simba-C produces EQGs as early as $z\sim 5$ and number densities agreeing with observations at $z\leq 3$ (though slightly low at $z\geq 4$). Using a photometric-based EQG selection or a fixed sSFR cut of $10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$ yields similar results. EQGs predominantly arise in central galaxies with stellar mass $M_\star\sim 10^{10.5-11.3}M_\odot$, not necessarily the most massive systems. A UMAP projection shows that quenched galaxies have notably large black hole-to-stellar mass ratios, lower rotational support, and less dust, but are not atypical versus similar-mass non-EQGs in their environments, halo mass, or halo gas temperatures at the time of quenching. However, via galaxy tracking we show that the progenitor environments of EQGs are significantly more overdense than that of non-EQGs, which drives higher black hole mass fractions and stellar-to-halo mass ratios. This results in the Eddington ratio dropping sufficiently low for Simba-C's jet mode feedback to turn on, which quickly quenches the host galaxies. EQGs thus seem to be galaxies that grow their black holes quickly within highly dense environments, but end up in moderately-dense environments where black hole feedback can quench effectively. We find that $\geq 30\%$ of EQGs rejuvenate, but the rejuvenating fraction drops quickly at $z\leq 2$. By $z=0$ it is difficult to distinguish the descendants of EQGs vs. non-EQGs.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Anschuetz, Xun Gao","Recent theoretical results in quantum machine learning have demonstrated a general trade-off between the expressive power of quantum neural networks (QNNs) and their trainability; as a corollary of these results, practical exponential separations in expressive power over classical machine learning models are believed to be infeasible as such QNNs take a time to train that is exponential in the model size. We here circumvent these negative results by constructing a hierarchy of efficiently trainable QNNs that exhibit unconditionally provable, polynomial memory separations of arbitrary constant degree over classical neural networks in performing a classical sequence modeling task. Furthermore, each unit cell of the introduced class of QNNs is computationally efficient, implementable in constant time on a quantum device. The classical networks we prove a separation over include well-known examples such as recurrent neural networks and Transformers. We show that quantum contextuality is the source of the expressivity separation, suggesting that other classical sequence learning problems with long-time correlations may be a regime where practical advantages in quantum machine learning may exist.",{'quantum machine learning': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In this work, we adapt it for the characterization of noise channels on near-term quantum computers and investigate its performance thoroughly. In particular, we show how experimentally feasible tomographic samples are sufficient to accurately characterize realistic correlated noise models affecting individual layers of quantum circuits, and study its performance on systems composed of up to 20 qubits. Furthermore, we combine this noise characterization method with a recently proposed noise-aware tensor network error mitigation protocol for correcting outcomes in noisy circuits, resulting accurate estimations even on deep circuit instances. This positions the tensor-network-based noise characterization protocol as a valuable tool for practical error characterization and mitigation in the near-term quantum computing era.","{'tensor network': 1, 'tensor networks': 1}",02.2024,2024,02,['Tensor Networks']
HQNET: Harnessing Quantum Noise for Effective Training of Quantum Neural Networks in NISQ Era,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.08475v2,"Muhammad Kashif, Muhammad Shafique","This paper delves into the intricate dynamics of quantum noise and its influence on the onset and mitigation of barren plateaus (BPs) - a phenomenon that critically impedes the scalability of QNNs. We find that BPs appear earlier in noisy quantum environments compared to ideal, noise-free conditions.However, strategic selection of qubit measurement observables can effectively tackle this issue. To this end, we examine a variety of observables, such as PauliZ,PauliX, PauliY, and a specially designed arbitrary Hermitian observable, tailored to the requirements of the cost function and the desired outputs of quantum circuits. Our analysis encompasses both global and local cost function definitions, with the former involving measurements across all qubits and the latter focusing on single-qubit measurements within the QNN framework. Our findings indicate that in a global cost function scenario, PauliX and PauliY observables lead to flatter optimization landscapes, signaling BPs with increasing qubits, especially in noisy conditions. Conversely, the PauliZ observable maintains trainability up to 8 qubits but encounters BPs at 10 qubits. Notably, the arbitrary Hermitian observable, when used with a global cost function, shows a unique advantage as it benefits from noise, facilitating effective training up to 10 qubits. Furthermore, with a local cost function, out of the three conventional observables (PauliX, PauliY and PauliZ), PauliZ is more effective, sustaining training efficiency under noisy conditions for up to 10 qubits, while PauliX and PauliY do not show similar benefits and remain susceptible to BPs. Our results highlight the importance of noise consideration in QNN training and propose a strategic approach to observable selection to improve QNN performance in noisy quantum computing environments thus contributing to the advancement of quantum machine learning research.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Recently, there have emerged research efforts that enable VQCs to perform non-linear operations. However, it is still unclear on the approximability of a given VQC (i.e., the order of non-linearity that can be handled by a specified design). In response to this issue, we developed an automated tool designed to benchmark the approximation of a given VQC. The proposed tool will generate a set of synthetic datasets with different orders of non-linearity and train the given VQC on these datasets to estimate their approximability. Our experiments benchmark VQCs with different designs, where we know their theoretic approximability.

Eccentricity leaves a distinct signature in gravitational wave signals and it may be measured if the binary remains eccentric when it enters the LIGO band. Although eccentricity has not yet been confidently detected, the possibility of detecting eccentric binaries is becoming more likely with the improved sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. It is crucial to assess the accuracy of current search pipelines in recovering eccentricity from gravitational wave signals if it is present. In this study, we investigate the ability of parameter estimation pipeline RIFT to recover eccentricity in the non-spinning and aligned-spin cases for low mass binary black holes.

Relativistic aerodynamics of spinning black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07981v2,"Conor Dyson, Jaime Redondo-Yuste, Maarten van de Meent, Vitor Cardoso","Astrophysical black holes do not exist in vacuum, and their motion is affected by the galactic environment. As a black hole moves it attracts stars and matter, creating a wake that, in turn, exerts an effective friction slowing down the black hole. This force is known as dynamical friction, and has significant consequences, ranging from the formation of supermassive black hole binaries to modifications in the phase of binary mergers. In this work we explore the motion of spinning black holes on a medium. We find that the classical drag along the velocity direction is modified and two novel forces appear: a rotational force, which in the context of fluid dynamics is dubbed the Magnus force, and a lift, orthogonal to the direction of motion. We develop a first-principles fully-relativistic treatment of these spin-induced aerodynamic forces in two types of environment: i) collisionless corpuscular matter and ii) a light scalar field, exploring the differences between both cases. In both cases we find that the total rotational force acts precisely in the opposite direction as compared to the classical set-up of a spinning ball moving through a fluid.

Computational complexity of isometric tensor network states,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07975v1,"Daniel Malz, Rahul Trivedi","We determine the computational power of isometric tensor network states (isoTNS), a variational ansatz originally developed to numerically find and compute properties of gapped ground states and topological states in two dimensions. By mapping 2D isoTNS to 1+1D unitary quantum circuits, we find that computing local expectation values in isoTNS is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete. We then introduce injective isoTNS, which are those isoTNS that are the unique ground states of frustration-free Hamiltonians, and which are characterized by an injectivity parameter $δ\in(0,1/D]$, where $D$ is the bond dimension of the isoTNS. We show that injectivity necessarily adds depolarizing noise to the circuit at a rate $η=δ^2D^2$. We show that weakly injective isoTNS (small $δ$) are still $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, but that there exists an efficient classical algorithm to compute local expectation values in strongly injective isoTNS ($η\geq0.41$). Sampling from isoTNS corresponds to monitored quantum dynamics and we exhibit a family of isoTNS that undergo a phase transition from a hard regime to an easy phase where the monitored circuit can be sampled efficiently. Our results can be used to design provable algorithms to contract isoTNS. Our mapping between ground states of certain frustration-free Hamiltonians to open circuit dynamics in one dimension fewer may be of independent interest.",{'tensor network': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Tensor Networks']
Gravitational Collapse in Energy-momentum squared gravity: Nature of singularities,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.07957v1,Prabir Rudra,"In this paper, we explore a collapsing scenario in the background of energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG). EMSG claims to have terms that originate from the quantum gravity effects mimicking loop quantum gravity. As a result, the framework admits a bounce at a finite time thus avoiding a singularity. So the question that naturally arises: Is there any realistic chance of the formation of a black hole or the quantum gravity effects are strong enough to totally avoid such a pathology? Motivated by this we are interested in studying a gravitational collapse mechanism in the background of EMSG and investigate the fate of such a process. We model the spacetime of a massive star by the Vaidya metric and derive the field equations in EMSG. Then using the equations we go on to study a gravitational collapse mechanism, on two specific models of EMSG with different forms of curvature-matter coupling. The prime objective is to probe the nature of singularity (if formed) as the end state of the collapse. We see that none of the models generically admit the formation of black holes as the end state of collapse, but on the contrary, they support the formation of naked singularities. This can be attributed to the quantum fluctuations of the gravitational interactions at the fundamental level.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The Hayward and Nielsen-Visser dynamical surface gravity are in agreement with the one resulting from the Killing vector of the outer static metric. However, these two definitions inside the star do not coincide with the Killing surface gravity outside the star when the star crosses the event horizon. This motivates us to study the surface gravity using Fodor's approach to have a unique surface gravity at the mentioned moment.

The extra freedom in imposing two constraints may now be exploited to include polytopes, something that is difficult in general relativity.

The parent sample of 491 COSMOS AGNs were identified by optical variability from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) program. Using publicly-available catalogs and spectra, we consolidate their spectroscopic redshifts and estimate virial black hole masses using broad line widths and luminosities. We show that variability searches with deep, high precision photometry like the HSC-SSP can identity AGNs in low mass galaxies up to $z\sim1$. However, their black holes are more massive given their host galaxy stellar masses than predicted by the local relation for active galaxies. We report that $z\sim 0.5-4$ variability-selected AGNs are meanwhile more consistent with the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation for local inactive early-type galaxies. This result is consistent with most previous studies of the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_{\ast}$ relation at similar redshifts and indicates that AGNs selected from variability are not intrinsically different from the broad-line Type 1 AGN population at similar luminosities. Our results demonstrate the need for robust black hole and stellar mass estimates for intermediate-mass black hole candidates in low-mass galaxies at similar redshifts.

Primordial Black Holes and Scalar-induced Gravitational Waves in Radiative Hybrid Inflation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06613v1,"Adeela Afzal, Anish Ghoshal","We study the possibility that primordial black holes (PBHs) can be formed from large curvature perturbations generated during the waterfall phase transition due to the effects of one-loop radiative corrections of Yukawa couplings between the inflaton and a dark fermion in a non-supersymmetric hybrid inflationary model. We obtain a spectral index, $n_s$ and a tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$ consistent with the current Planck data. Our findings show that the abundance of PBHs are correlated to the dark fermion mass $m_N$ and peak in the GW spectrum. We identify parameter space where PBHs can be the entire dark matter (DM) candidate of the universe or a fraction of it. Our predictions are consistent with any existing constraints of PBH from microlensing, BBN, and CMB, etc. Moreover, the scenario is also testable via induced gravitational waves (GWs) from first-order scalar perturbations detectable in future observatories such as LISA and ET. For instance, with inflaton mass $m \sim 2\times 10^{12}$ GeV, $m_N \sim 5.4\times 10^{15}$ GeV, we obtain PBHs of around $10^{-13}\, M_\odot$ mass that can explain the entire abundance of DM and predict GWs with amplitude $Ω_{\rm GW}h^2$ $\sim 10^{-9}$ with peak frequency $f$ $\sim$ $0.1$ Hz in LISA. By explicitly estimating fine-tuning we show the model has very mild tuning. We discuss successful reheating at the end of the inflationary phase via the conversion of the waterfall field into standard model (SM) particles. We also briefly speculate a scenario where the dark fermion can be the possible heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN) which is responsible for generating the SM neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. The RHN can be produced due to waterfall field decay and its subsequent decay may also explain the observed baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06455v1,"Arne Wulff, Boyang Chen, Matthew Steinberg, Yinglu Tang, Matthias Möller, Sebastian Feld","As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. For this purpose, we derived a matrix product operator representation of the loss function Hamiltonian and the penalty terms. Numerical trials with this algorithm successfully yielded approximate solutions, while exhibiting a tradeoff between accuracy and runtime. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.","{'quantum computer': 1, 'tensor network': 2}",02.2024,2024,02,"['Tensor Networks', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

Conversely, in RN singularities, additional image tracks can be found inner the critical curve, originating from photons reflected by the infinitely high effective potential well. Moreover, we found incomplete and converge tracks from the time integrated images of hot spot orbiting RN singularities lacking of a photon sphere. The presence of these additional image tracks exerts a significant influence on temporal magnitudes at their local maxima, allowing us to differentiate between RN black holes and RN naked singularities.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Stellar streams from black hole-rich star clusters,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06393v1,"Daniel Roberts, Mark Gieles, Denis Erkal, Jason L. Sanders","Nearly a hundred progenitor-less, thin stellar streams have been discovered in the Milky Way, thanks to Gaia and related surveys. Most streams are believed to have formed from star clusters and it was recently proposed that extended star clusters -- rich in stellar-mass black holes (BHs) -- are efficient in creating streams. To understand the nature of stream progenitors better, we quantify the differences between streams originating from star clusters with and without BHs using direct $N$-body models and a new model for the density profiles of streams based on time-dependent escape rates from clusters. The QSG (Quantifying Stream Growth) model facilitates the rapid exploration of parameter space and provides an analytic framework to understand the impact of different star cluster properties and escape conditions on the structure of streams. Using these models it is found that, compared to streams from BH-free clusters on the same orbit, streams of BH-rich clusters: (1) are approximately five times more massive; (2) have a peak density three times closer to the cluster 1 Gyr post-dissolution (for orbits of Galactocentric radius > 10 kpc), and (3) have narrower peaks and more extended wings in their density profile. We discuss other observable stream properties that are affected by the presence of BHs in their progenitor cluster, namely the width of the stream, its radial offset from the orbit, and the properties of the gap at the progenitor's location. Our results provide a step towards using stellar streams to constrain the BH content of dissolved (globular) star clusters.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Schrödinger Connections: From Mathematical Foundations Towards Yano-Schrödinger Cosmology,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06167v1,Lehel Csillag,"In the present paper we introduce a novel coordinate-free formulation of Schrödinger connections, which are a special class of affine connections, first considered by Schrödinger. After recasting some basic properties in a differential geometric language, we show that Schrödinger connections can be realized through torsion, non-metricity or both. Considering a semi-symmetric type of torsion and a Weyl type non-metricity, the curvature tensors of Weyl-Schrödinger, Yano-Schrödinger and Friedmann-Weyl-Schrödinger connections are calculated. With the help of a de Sitter type FLRW metric and a Yano-Schrödinger connection, we construct for the first time in the literature an explicit example of a non-static Einstein manifold realized by torsion. Having presented the mathematical foundations, we propose a geometric generalization of standard general relativity based on Yano-Schrödinger geometry. After formulating the Einstein equations, we derive the Friedmann equations and obtain analytical de Sitter solutions. The physical feasability of the proposed theory is tested by considering a cosmological model in which matter is conserved. The theoretical predictions of Yano-Schrödinger gravity are compared with observational data for the Hubble function and with the standard $Λ$CDM paradigm.

Barycentric and Pairwise Renyi Quantum Leakage,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.06156v1,Farhad Farokhi,"Barycentric and pairwise quantum Renyi leakages are proposed as two measures of information leakage for privacy and security analysis in quantum computing and communication systems. These quantities both require minimal assumptions on the eavesdropper, i.e., they do not make any assumptions on the eavesdropper's attack strategy or the statistical prior on the secret or private classical data encoded in the quantum system. They also satisfy important properties of positivity, independence, post-processing inequality, and unitary invariance. The barycentric quantum Renyi leakage can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and the pairwise quantum Renyi leakage possesses an explicit formula. The barycentric and pairwise quantum Renyi leakages form upper bounds on the maximal quantum leakage, the sandwiched quantum $α$-mutual information, the accessible information, and the Holevo's information. Furthermore, differentially-private quantum channels are shown to bound these measures of information leakage. Global and local depolarizing channels, that are common models of noise in quantum computing and communication, restrict private or secure information leakage. Finally, a privacy-utility trade-off formula in quantum machine learning using variational circuits is developed.

The non-collinear phase of the antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05759v1,"R. Rausch, C. Karrasch","The antiferromagnetic sawtooth chain is a prototypical example of a frustrated spin system with vertex-sharing triangles, giving rise to complex quantum states. Depending on the interaction parameters, this system has three phases, of which the gapless non-collinear phase (for strongly coupled basal spins and loosely attached apical spins) has received little theoretical attention so far. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the properties of the non-collinear phase using large-scale tensor network computations which exploit the full SU(2) symmetry of the underlying Heisenberg model. We study the ground state both for finite systems using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) as well as for infinite chains via the variational uniform matrix-product state (VUMPS) formalism. Finite temperatures and correlation functions are tackled via imaginary- or real time evolutions, which we implement using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). We find that the non-collinear phase is characterized by a double-Q structure for the apex-apex correlations. Deep into the phase, two peaks merge into a single one indicating a 90-degree spiral. The apical spins are soft and highly susceptible to external perturbations; they form a large number of gapless magnetic states that are polarized by weak fields and cause a long low-temperature tail in the specific heat. The dynamic spin-structure factor exhibits additive contributions from a two-spinon continuum (excitations of the basal chain) and a gapless peak at $k=π/2$ (excitations of the apical spins). Small temperatures excite the gapless states and smear the spectral weight of the $k=π/2$ peak out into a homogeneous flat-band structure.

Araújo Filho, Ratbay Myrzakulov, Adam Z. Kaczmarek, Javlon Rayimbaev, Dominik Szczȩśniak","This paper investigates the contribution of the nonsingular Yukawa-modified potential in the context of four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity modeling by a static and spherically symmetric black hole solution. These Yukawa-type corrections are essentially described along two parameters, $β$ and $λ$, affecting Newton's law of gravity at large distances, and a deformation parameter $\ell_0$, which is essential at short distances. Primarily, the strongest effect is encoded in $β$, which alters the total mass of the black hole with additional mass proportional to $β\mathcal{M}$, imitating the effects of dark matter at large distances from the black hole. In contrast, the effect due to $λ$ is small for astrophysical values. On the other hand, the EGB gravity is ruled by the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupling constant $α$, a fundamental parameter of the theory. We pay particular attention to thermodynamic stability, critical orbits, geodesics and quasinormal modes.

Weight Reduced Stabilizer Codes with Lower Overhead,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05228v1,"Eric Sabo, Lane G. Gunderman, Benjamin Ide, Michael Vasmer, Guillaume Dauphinais","Stabilizer codes are the most widely studied class of quantum error-correcting codes and form the basis of most proposals for a fault-tolerant quantum computer. A stabilizer code is defined by a set of parity-check operators, which are measured in order to infer information about errors that may have occurred. In typical settings, measuring these operators is itself a noisy process and the noise strength scales with the number of qubits involved in a given parity check, or its weight. Hastings proposed a method for reducing the weights of the parity checks of a stabilizer code, though it has previously only been studied in the asymptotic regime. Here, we instead focus on the regime of small-to-medium size codes suitable for quantum computing hardware. We provide both a fully explicit description of Hastings's method and propose a substantially simplified weight reduction method that is applicable to the class of quantum product codes. Our simplified method allows us to reduce the check weights of hypergraph and lifted product codes to at most six, while preserving the number of logical qubits and at least retaining (in fact often increasing) the code distance. The price we pay is an increase in the number of physical qubits by a constant factor, but we find that our method is much more efficient than Hastings's method in this regard. We benchmark the performance of our codes in a photonic quantum computing architecture based on GKP qubits and passive linear optics, finding that our weight reduction method substantially improves code performance.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Placing them in the interior of primordial rotating black holes, which act as natural amplifiers, we show that massive charged bosonic fields in their vicinity exhibit a superradiant instability which surpasses significantly that of neutral Kerr black holes. Strikingly, this is true for black holes containing an order-one number of magnetic monopoles, or merely a single one, and possessing either low, moderate or large values of angular momentum. In particular, the instability is drastically faster than the radiative decay time of charged pions, thus making it physically relevant. Furthermore, our analysis identifies the most unstable modes as a class of monopole spheroidal harmonics, that we dub north and south monopole modes, whose morphology is markedly different from the usual superradiantly unstable modes since they extend along the rotational axis.

We give the action, energy, entropy, temperature, and heat capacity. $T$, $Λ$, the black hole radius $r_+$, and the cosmological horizon radius $r_{\rm c}$, are gauged in $R$ units to $RT$, $ΛR^2$, $\frac{r_+}{R}$, and $\frac{r_{\rm c}}{R}$. The whole extension of $ΛR^2$, $0\leqΛR^2\leq 3$, is divided into three ranges. The first, $0\leqΛR^2<1$, includes York's Schwarzschild black holes. The second range, $ΛR^2=1$, opens up a folder of Nariai universes. The third range, $1<ΛR^2\leq 3$, is unusual. One feature here is that it interchanges the cosmological horizon with the black hole horizon. The end point, $ΛR^2=3$, only existing for infinite $RT$, is a cavity filled with de Sitter space, except for a singularity, with the cosmological horizon coinciding with the reservoir. For the three ranges, for low temperatures, there are no black holes and no Nariai universes, the space is hot de Sitter. The value of $RT$ that divides the nonexistence from existence of black holes or Nariai universes, depends on $ΛR^2$. For each $ΛR^2\neq1$, for high temperatures, there is one small and thermodynamically unstable black hole, and one large and stable. For $ΛR^2=1$, for high temperatures, there is the unstable black hole, and the neutrally stable Nariai universe. Phase transitions can be analyzed.

In three spacetime dimensions, and taking $K$ constant on a toroidal Euclidean boundary, we find that the spacetime is thermally stable for all $K$. In four spacetime dimensions, the thermal stability depends on the value of $K$. It is established that for sufficiently large $K$, the de Sitter static patch subject to conformal boundary conditions is thermally stable. This contrasts the Dirichlet problem for which the region encompassing the cosmological horizon has negative specific heat. We present an analysis of the linearised Einstein equations subject to conformal boundary conditions. In the worldline limit of the timelike boundary, the underlying modes are linked to the quasinormal modes of the static patch. In the limit where the timelike boundary approaches the cosmological event horizon, the linearised modes are interpreted in terms of the shear and sound modes of a fluid dynamical system. Additionally, we find modes with a frequency of positive imaginary part. Measured in a local inertial reference frame, and taking the stretched cosmological horizon limit, these modes grow at most polynomially.",{'einstein equations': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']
Black holes and gravitational waves from slow phase transitions,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04158v1,"Marek Lewicki, Piotr Toczek, Ville Vaskonen","Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $β/H_0 < 10$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Due to the proliferation of prime closed geodesics, the series form for the Casimir energy has an IR divergence. The expression for E is given as a sum of polylogarithms which allows the divergence to be isolated and rendered finite by an {\it ad hoc} Ramanujan renormalisation.

This is the rough picture occurring near black holes or other strongly gravitating centers that produce observed phenomena such as astrophysical jets. A toy model that can be considered imitating such a process is colliding null sources in general relativity. We present such a simple model projected into the plane of null coordinates that takes into account only neutral sources. We show that even at such a simplified model, uncharged and non-rotating, it is possible to obtain jet-like ejections albeit they lie below the horizon. In the present study the spacetime consists of either one of i) a cloud of strings, ii) a global monopole, iii) a particular model of bumblebee gravity, all described by a similar class of stress-energy tensor. There are gravitational waves accompanying the null sources and naturally collision of gravitational waves is also taken into account. After the collision, the spacetime contains both null and non-null sources, followed by trailing gravitational radiations.

Quantum error mitigation by layerwise Richardson extrapolation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04000v1,"Vincent Russo, Andrea Mari","A widely used method for mitigating errors in noisy quantum computers is Richardson extrapolation, a technique in which the overall effect of noise on the estimation of quantum expectation values is captured by a single parameter that, after being scaled to larger values, is eventually extrapolated to the zero-noise limit. We generalize this approach by introducing \emph{layerwise Richardson extrapolation (LRE)}, an error mitigation protocol in which the noise of different individual layers (or larger chunks of the circuit) is amplified and the associated expectation values are linearly combined to estimate the zero-noise limit. The coefficients of the linear combination are analytically obtained from the theory of multivariate Lagrange interpolation. LRE leverages the flexible configurational space of layerwise unitary folding, allowing for a more nuanced mitigation of errors by treating the noise level of each layer of the quantum circuit as an independent variable. We provide numerical simulations demonstrating scenarios where LRE achieves superior performance compared to traditional (single-variable) Richardson extrapolation.",{'quantum circuit': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
The Bethe Ansatz for the superconformal index with unequal angular momenta,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03977v2,"Ofer Aharony, Ohad Mamroud, Shimon Nowik, Meir Weissman","A few years ago it was shown that the superconformal index of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the large $N$ limit matches with the entropy of $1/16$-supersymmetric black holes in type IIB string theory on $AdS_5\times S^5$. In some cases, an even more detailed match between the two sides is possible. When the two angular momentum chemical potentials in the index are equal, the superconformal index can be written as a discrete sum of Bethe ansatz solutions, and it was shown that specific terms in this sum are in a one-to-one correspondence to stable black hole solutions, and that the matching can be extended to non-perturbative contributions from wrapped D3-branes. A Bethe ansatz approach to computing the superconformal index exists also when the ratio of the angular momentum chemical potentials is any rational number, but in those cases it involves a sum over a very large number of terms (growing exponentially with $N$). Benini et al showed that a specific one of these terms matches with the black hole, but the role of the other terms is not clear. In this paper we analyze some of the additional contributions to the index in the Bethe ansatz approach, and we find that their matching to the gravity side is much more complicated than in the case of equal chemical potentials. In particular, we find some contributions that are larger than the one which was found to match the black holes, so that they must cancel with other large contributions. We give some evidence that cancellations of this type are possible, but we leave a full understanding of how they work to the future.",{'black holes': 2},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Employing a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the PBH model using the LVK third GW Transient Catalog (GWTC-3), revealing that stellar-mass PBHs cannot dominate cold dark matter. Considering a mixed population of astrophysical black holes (ABHs) and PBHs, we determine that approximately $1/4$ of the detectable events in the GWTC-3 can be attributed to PBH binaries.

In this paper, we report NOEMA observations of six apparent starburst HyLIRGs associated with optical quasars at $z\sim2-3$ in the Stripe 82 field, to study their dust and molecular CO properties. Five out of the six candidates are detected with CO(4-3) or CO(5-4) emission, and four in 2mm dust continuum. Based on the linewidth-$L'_{\rm{CO(1-0)}}$ diagnostics, we find that four galaxies are likely unlensed or weakly lensed sources.

We notice interesting offsets, of $\sim10-40$ kpc spatially or $\sim1000-2000$ km s$^{-1}$ spectroscopically, between the optical quasar and the mm continuum or CO emissions. The observed velocity shift is likely related to the blueshifted broad-emission-line region of quasars, though mergers or recoiling black holes are also possible causes, which can explain the spatial offset and the high intrinsic SFRs in the HyLIRG-quasar systems.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

However, the question remains if (G)QML can be routinely used for constructing protocols with an exponential separation from classical analogs. In this Letter we consider Simon's problem for learning properties of Boolean functions, and show that this can be related to an unsupervised circuit classification problem. Using the workflow of geometric QML, we learn from first principles Simon's algorithm, thus discovering an example of BQP$^A\neq$BPP protocol with respect to some dataset (oracle $A$). Our key findings include the development of an equivariant feature map for embedding Boolean functions, based on twirling with respect to identified bitflip and permutational symmetries, and measurement based on invariant observables with a sampling advantage. The proposed workflow points to the importance of data embeddings and classical post-processing, while keeping the variational circuit as a trivial identity operator. Next, developing the intuition for the function learning, we visualize instances as directed computational hypergraphs, and observe that the GQML protocol can access their global topological features for distinguishing bijective and surjective functions. Finally, we discuss the prospects for learning other BQP$^A$-type protocols, and conjecture that this depends on the ability of simplifying embeddings-based oracles $A$ applied as a linear combination of unitaries.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

However, the lowest mass seeds ($\lesssim10^3 M_{\odot}$) are inaccessible to most cosmological simulations due to resolution limitations. We present our new BRAHMA suite of cosmological simulations that uses a novel flexible seeding approach to represent low mass seeds. Our suite consists of two types of boxes that model $\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$ seeds using two distinct but mutually consistent seeding prescriptions at different simulation resolutions. First, we have the highest resolution $[9~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-9-D3) boxes that directly resolve $\sim10^3~M_{\odot}$ seeds and place them within halos with dense and metal poor gas. Second, we have lower-resolution and larger-volume $[18~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-18-E4) and $\sim[36~\mathrm{Mpc}]^3$ (BRAHMA-36-E5) boxes that seed their smallest resolvable $\sim10^4~\&~10^5~\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ BH descendants using new stochastic seeding prescriptions calibrated using the BRAHMA-9-D3 results. The three boxes together probe BHs between $\sim10^3-10^7 M_{\odot}$ at $z>7$ and we predict their key observables. The variation in the AGN luminosity functions is small (factors of $\sim2-3$) at the anticipated detection limits of potential future X-ray facilities ($\sim10^{43} \mathrm{ergs~s^{-1}}$ at $z\sim7$). Our simulations predict BHs $\sim10-100$ times heavier than expectations from local $M_*$ vs $M_{bh}$ relations, consistent with several JWST-detected AGN. For different seed models, our simulations merge BH binaries at $\sim1-15~\mathrm{kpc}$, with rates of $\sim200-2000$ per year for $\gtrsim10^3 M_{\odot}$ BHs, $\sim6-60$ per year for $\gtrsim10^4~M_{\odot}$ BHs, and up to $\sim10$ per year amongst $\gtrsim10^5 M_{\odot}$ BHs.

In particular, we focus on post-inflationary scenarios where there are no self-resonances and the reheating epoch can be described {by the inflaton evolving in} a quadratic-like potential. In the hydrodynamical interpretation of this field during the slow-reheating epoch, the gravitational collapse of primordial fluctuations is subject to conditions on their sphericity, limits on their spin, as well as a maximum velocity dispersion. We show how to account for all conditions and show that PBHs form with different masses depending on the collapse mechanism.

Dai","Tidal disruption events (TDEs) are multi-messenger transients in which a star is tidally destroyed by a supermassive black hole at the center of galaxies. The Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is anticipated to annually detect hundreds to thousands of TDEs, such that the first gravitationally lensed TDE may be observed in the coming years. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, we quantify the rate of both unlensed and lensed TDEs as a function of limiting magnitudes in four different optical bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$) for a range of TDE temperatures that match observations. Dependent on the temperature and luminosity model, we find that $g$ and $r$ bands are the most promising bands with unlensed TDE detections that can be as high as ${\sim}10^{4}$ annually. By populating a cosmic volume with realistic distributions of TDEs and galaxies that can act as gravitational lenses, we estimate that a few lensed TDEs (depending on the TDE luminosity model) can be detected annually in $g$ or $r$ bands in the LSST survey, with TDE redshifts in the range of ${\sim}0.5$ to ${\sim}2$. The ratio of lensed to unlensed detections indicates that we may detect ${\sim}1$ lensed event for every $10^{4}$ unlensed events, which is independent of the luminosity model. The number of lensed TDEs decreases as a function of the image separations and time delays, and most of the lensed TDE systems are expected to have image separations below ${\sim}3""$ and time delays within ${\sim}30$ days. At fainter limiting magnitudes, the $i$ band becomes notably more successful. These results suggest that strongly lensed TDEs are likely to be observed within the coming years and such detections will enable us to study the demographics of black holes at higher redshifts through the lensing magnifications.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

Instead of sequentially applying local unitary gates, we sequentially evolve the Hamiltonian by changing local terms in one subregion and then the next. The Hamiltonian remains gapped throughout the process, giving rise to an adiabatic evolution mapping the ground state from a product state to a chiral topological state. We demonstrate such a sequential adiabatic generation process for free fermion chiral states like the Chern Insulator and the $p+ip$ superconductor.

Stuchlik","We study the accretion flows towards a central Kerr super-spinning attractor, discussing the formation of the flow inversion points, defined by condition $u^φ=0$ on the particles flow axial velocity. We locate two closed surfaces, defining \emph{inversion coronas} (spherical shells), surrounding the central attractor. The coronas analysis highlights observational aspects distinguishing the central attractors and providing indications on their spin and the orbiting fluids.
  The inversion corona is a closed region, generally of small extension and thickness, which is for the counter-rotating flows of the order of $\lesssim 1.4 M$ (central attractor mass) on the vertical rotational axis.
  There are no co-rotating inversion points (from co-rotating flows). The results point to strong signatures of the Kerr super-spinars, provided in both accretion and jet flows. With very narrow thickness, and varying little with the fluid initial conditions and the emission process details, inversion coronas can have remarkable observational significance for primordial Kerr super-spinars predicted by string theory. The corona region closest to the central attractor is the most observably recognizable and active part, distinguishing black holes solutions from super-spinars.

Unleashing the Expressive Power of Pulse-Based Quantum Neural Networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02880v1,"Han-Xiao Tao, Jiaqi Hu, Re-Bing Wu","Quantum machine learning (QML) based on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices requires the optimal utilization of limited quantum resources. The commonly used gate-based QML models are convenient for software engineers, but their expressivity is restricted by the permissible circuit depth within a finite coherence time. In contrast, pulse-based models enable the construction of ""infinitely"" deep quantum neural networks within the same coherence time, which may unleash greater expressive power for complex learning tasks. In this paper, we investigate this potential from the perspective of quantum control theory. We first indicate that the nonlinearity of pulse-based models comes from the encoding process that can be viewed as the continuous limit of data-reuploading in gate-based models. Subsequently, we prove that the pulse-based model can approximate arbitrary nonlinear functions when the underlying physical system is ensemble controllable. Under this condition, numerical simulations show that the expressivity can be enhanced by either increasing the pulse length or the number of qubits. As anticipated, we demonstrate through numerical examples that the pulse-based model can unleash more expressive power compared to the gate-based model. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for understanding and designing expressive QML models using NISQ devices.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Geometrically thick equilibrium tori around a Schwarzschild black hole in swirling universes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02789v1,"Chengjia Chen, Qiyuan Pan, Jiliang Jing","We study geometrically thick non-self gravitating equilibrium tori orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in swirling universes. This solution is axially symmetric and non-asymptotically flat, and its north and south hemispheres spin in opposite directions. Due to repulsive effects arising from the swirl of the background spacetime, the equilibrium torus exists only in the case with the small swirling parameter. With the increase of the swirling parameter, the disk structure becomes small and the excretion of matter near the black hole becomes strong. Moreover, the odd $Z_2$ symmetry of spacetimes originating from the swirling parameter yields that the orientation of closed equipotential surfaces deviates away from the horizontal axis and the corresponding disk does not longer possess the symmetry with respect to the equatorial plane. These significant features could help to further understand the equilibrium tori and geometrically thick accretion disks around black holes in swirling universes.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

This study shows numerical evidence for a quadratic speedup of the Grover Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (G-QAOA) over random sampling for finding all solutions to 3-SAT problems (All-SAT). G-QAOA is less resource-intensive and more adaptable for 3-SAT and Max-SAT than Grover's algorithm, and it surpasses conventional QAOA in its ability to sample all solutions. We show these benefits by classical simulations of many-round G-QAOA on thousands of random 3-SAT instances. We also observe G-QAOA advantages on the IonQ Aria quantum computer for small instances, finding that current hardware suffices to determine and sample all solutions. Interestingly, a single-angle-pair constraint that uses the same pair of angles at each G-QAOA round greatly reduces the classical computational overhead of optimizing the G-QAOA angles while preserving its quadratic speedup. We also find parameter clustering of the angles. The single-angle-pair protocol and parameter clustering significantly reduce obstacles to classical optimization of the G-QAOA angles.",{'quantum computer': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

The inclusion of space-dependent Rabi coupling can induce an effective space-dependent mass term. We study superradiant instabilities resulting from the quasibound states corresponding to positive mass squared and the tachyonic instabilities arising from negative mass squared in both frequency and time domains.

Efficiency of magnetic Penrose process in higher dimensional Myers-Perry black hole spacetimes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02471v1,Sanjar Shaymatov,"In this paper, we consider a well-established magnetic Penrose process (MPP) and bring out its impact on the efficiency of energy extraction from higher $D>4$ dimensional black holes. We further consider the efficiency of energy extraction from black holes with $(n-1)$ and $n$ rotations. We show that when black hole has $(n-1)$ rotations it has only one horizon and hence the energy efficiency is infinitely large even without MPP. If black hole has $n$ rotations in $D>4$, the energy efficiency becomes not infinitely large in contrast to the one with $(n-1)$ rotations. However, it turns out that the efficiency of energy extraction from black holes with $n$ rotations is enormously enhanced by MPP. Hence, the arbitrarily large energy efficiency can be compensated by MPP. We further show that the efficiency of energy extraction can exceed over 150$\%$ and 200$\%$ for $D=5,\, 6$ and $>$200$\%$ for $D=7,\,8$ dimensions, respectively. It is also interestingly found that for about the extremal value of rotation parameters the energy efficiency remains above $100 \%$ in $D=7,\,8$ as compared with that in $D=5,6$ dimensions.

In this paper, we fully characterize the depth overhead by the routing number of the underlying constraint graph, a graph-theoretic measure which has been studied for 3 decades.

To be specific, we theoretically depict how the prediction error of variational quantum AdaBoost on binary classification decreases with the increase of the number of boosting rounds and sample size. By employing quantum convolutional neural networks, we further demonstrate that variational quantum AdaBoost can not only achieve much higher accuracy in prediction, but also help mitigate the impact of noise.

General Relativistic Hydrodynamics in Discrete Spacetime: Perfect Fluid Accretion onto Static and Spinning Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02331v1,Jonathan Gorard,"We study the problem of a spherically-symmetric distribution of a perfect relativistic fluid accreting onto a (potentially spinning) black hole within a fully discrete spacetime setting. This problem has previously been studied extensively in the context of continuum spacetimes, beginning with the purely analytic work of Bondi in the spherically-symmetric Newtonian case, Michel in the spherically-symmetric general relativistic case, and Petrich, Shapiro and Teukolsky in the axially-symmetric general relativistic case relevant for spinning black holes. However, the purpose of the present work is to determine the effect of discretization of the underlying spacetime upon the mass/energy and momentum accretion rates, the overall morphology and characteristics of the accretion flow, and the drag force exerted on the black hole in the case of non-zero spin. In order to achieve this, we first develop a novel formulation of the equations of general relativistic hydrodynamics that is more directly amenable to rigorous analysis within a discrete spacetime setting, and we then proceed to implement this formulation into the Gravitas computational general relativity framework. Through a combination of mathematical analysis and explicit numerical simulation in Gravitas, we discover that the mass/energy and momentum accretion rates both decrease monotonically as functions of the underlying spacetime discretization scale, with this effect becoming more pronounced for higher values of the black hole spin parameter, higher fluid temperatures, and stiffer equation of state parameters. We also find that the exerted drag force is highly sensitive to the value of the underlying discretization scale in the case of spinning black hole spacetimes, with certain instabilities becoming significantly more pronounced at certain critical values of the discretization parameter.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

We study the effect of free parameters on the Joule-Thomson coefficient (JTC), the inversion curve, and the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$. The isenthalpic curves of the AKS black hole show cooling or heating behavior depending on the inversion curve, which is affected by the mass and the parameters $b$ and $a$ of the black hole. If we assume the parameter $b$ to be zero, the results reduce to the Kerr-AdS black holes[1]. In [2,3], for the Einstein-Power-Yang-Mills AdS black hole with $q>1$ and $n=2$, the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ is $1/2$. But in this paper, for the AdS-Maxwell-power-Yang-Mills black hole, when $q>1$, the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ is almost equal to $1/2$ for the increase of Maxwell's charge $C$, and when $q=1/2$, the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ is equal to $1/2$ for all values of $C$. Also, when $1/2<q<1$, the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ is close to the value of $1/2$, and finally when $0<q<1/2$, the values of $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ move away from the value of $1/2$, that is, they become smaller. For the AKS black hole, we found that for free parameters $a=0.00951$ and $b=0.00475$, the $T_i^{min}/T_{c}$ is almost $1/2$.

The dynamics and gravitational-wave signal of a binary flying closely by a Kerr supermassive black hole,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02178v1,"Zhongfu Zhang, Xian Chen","Recent astrophysical models predict that stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs) could form and coalesce within a few gravitational radii of a supermassive black hole (SMBH). Detecting the gravitational waves (GWs) from such systems requires numerical tools which can track the dynamics of the binaries while capturing all the essential relativistic effects. This work develops upon our earlier study of a BBH moving along a circular orbit in the equatorial plane of a Kerr SMBH. Here we modify the numerical method to simulate a BBH falling toward the SMBH along a parabolic orbit of arbitrary inclination with respect to the equator. By tracking the evolution in a frame freely falling alongside the binary, we find that the eccentricity of the BBH is more easily excited than it is in the previous equatorial case, and that the cause is the asymmetry of the tidal tensor imposed on the binary when the binary moves out of the equatorial plane. Since the eccentricity reaches maximum around the same time that the BBH becomes the closest to the SMBH, multi-band GW bursts could be produced which are simultaneously detectable by the space- and ground-based detectors. We show that the effective spins of such GW events also undergo significant variation due to the rapid reorientation of the inner BBHs during their interaction with SMBHs. These results demonstrate the richness of three-body dynamics in the region of strong gravity, and highlight the necessity of building new numerical tools to simulate such systems.",{'black holes': 1},02.2024,2024,02,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we investigate the onset of TI in an irreversible, parametrically-driven, frequency conversion process in a system consisting of a superconducting 3D-cavity coupled to a fixed-frequency transmon qubit. Above a critical pump power we find a sudden increase in the transmon population. Using Renyi entropy, Floquet modes, and Husimi Q functions, we infer that this abrupt change can be attributed to a quantum-to-classical phase transition. Furthermore, in the context of the single-photon detection, we measure a TI-uncorrected detection efficiency of up to 86% and estimate a TI-corrected value of up to 78% by exploiting the irreversible frequency conversion. Our numerical simulations suggest that increasing the detuning between the pump and qubit frequencies and increasing the qubit anharmonicity can suppress the TI impact.

An accurate quantification of its relevance is therefore mandatory. We present a study aimed at evaluating the importance of obscuration in high redshift jetted QSO, i.e. those active nuclei characterized by the presence of powerful relativistic jets. We compare the observed number of radio detected QSO at different radio flux density limits with the value predicted by the beaming model on the basis of the number of oriented sources (blazars). Any significant deficit of radio-detected QSO compared to the predictions can be caused by the presence of obscuration along large angles from the jet direction. We apply this method to two sizable samples characterized by the same optical limit (mag=21) but significantly different radio density limits (30 mJy and 1 mJy respectively) and containing a total of 87 independent radio-loud 4<z<6.8 QSO, 31 of which classified as blazars. We find a general good agreement between the numbers predicted by the model and those actually observed, with only a marginal discrepancy at 0.5 mJy that could be caused by the lack of completeness of the sample. We conclude that we have no evidence of obscuration within angles 10-20deg from the relativistic jet direction. We also show how the ongoing deep wide-angle radio surveys will be instrumental to test the presence of obscuration at much larger angles, up to 30-35deg.

As one of the archetypal strongly correlated materials, vanadium dioxide (VO2) undergoes a structural phase transition (SPT) from a monoclinic (M1) to rutile (R) structure and an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) either when heated above 340 K or when excited by an ultrafast laser pulse. Here, we present a tensor network study of the light-induced phase transitions in VO2 based on a quasi-one-dimensional model with all the important ingredients -- multi-orbital character, electron-lattice coupling, and electron-electron correlations -- being included. We show that this model qualitatively captures the equilibrium properties of VO2 by calculating the ground state phase diagram and finite-temperature phase transitions. A hybrid quantum-classical tensor-network method is used to simulate the dynamics following photoexcitation. We find that the structure can transform faster than the harmonic phonon modes of M1 phase, suggesting lattice nonlinearity is key in the SPT. We also find separate timescales for the evolution of dimerization and tilt distortions in the lattice dynamics, as well as the loss and subsequent partial restoration behavior of the displacements, which can provide an explanation for the complex dynamics observed in recent experiments [C. Brahms et al., arXiv:XXXX.XXXXX].

In addition to quantum processing, sensing, and storage, transferring the resulting quantum states demands a careful design that finds no parallel in classical communication. Existing experimental demonstrations of quantum information transfer in solid-state quantum systems are largely confined to small chains with few qubits, often relying upon non-generic schemes. Here, by using a large-scale superconducting quantum circuit featuring thirty-six tunable qubits, accompanied by general optimization procedures deeply rooted in overcoming quantum chaotic behavior, we demonstrate a scalable protocol for transferring few-particle quantum states in a two-dimensional quantum network. These include single-qubit excitation and also two-qubit entangled states, and two excitations for which many-body effects are present.

Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00840v2,"Zohreh Davoudi, Chung-Chun Hsieh, Saurabh V. Kadam","Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique.

Current QNN models primarily employ variational circuits on an ansatz or a quantum feature map, often requiring multiple entanglement layers. This methodology not only increases the computational cost of the circuit beyond what is practical on near-term quantum devices but also misleadingly labels these models as neural networks, given their divergence from the structure of a typical feed-forward neural network (FFNN). Moreover, the circuit depth and qubit needs of these models scale poorly with the number of data features, resulting in an efficiency challenge for real-world machine-learning tasks. We introduce a bona fide QNN model, which seamlessly aligns with the versatility of a traditional FFNN in terms of its adaptable intermediate layers and nodes, absent from intermediate measurements such that our entire model is coherent. This model stands out with its reduced circuit depth and number of requisite C-NOT gates to outperform prevailing QNN models.

Many techniques exist for solving the quantum circuit mapping problem, many of which relate quantum circuit mapping to classical computer science. This work considers a novel perspective on quantum circuit mapping, in which the routing process of a simplified circuit is viewed as a composition of quantum operations acting on density matrices representing the quantum circuit and processor. Drawing on insight from recent advances in quantum information theory and information geometry, we show that a minimal SWAP gate count for executing a quantum circuit on a device emerges via the minimization of the distance between quantum states using the quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence. Additionally, we develop a novel initial placement algorithm based on a graph similarity search that selects the partition nearest to a graph isomorphism between interaction and coupling graphs. From these two ingredients, we then construct a polynomial-time algorithm for calculating the SWAP gate lower bound, which is directly compared alongside the IBM Qiskit compiler for over 600 realistic benchmark experiments, as well as against a brute-force method for smaller benchmarks. In our simulations, we unambiguously find that neither the brute-force method nor the Qiskit compiler surpass our bound, implying utility as a precise estimation of minimal overhead when realizing quantum algorithms on constrained quantum hardware.

Here, we take into account the anisotropic radiation feedback and the sublimation of dust grains. Our simulations show that when the relative velocity between the BH and the gas is small (~20 km/s) and gas density is ~10^4/cm^3, the gas mainly accretes from near the equatorial plane of the accretion disk at a time-averaged rate of 0.6% of the Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton rate. An ionized region like two spheres glued together at the equatorial plane is formed, and the dense shock shell appears near the ionization front.

The data suggests a rapid decline in the density of dark matter beyond $19$~kpc. We fit the whole rotation curve with four components (gas, disk, bulge and halo) and compute the microlensing optical depth to the Large Magellanic Cloud. With this model of the galaxy we reanalyse the microlensing events of the MACHO and EROS-2 Collaborations. Using the published MACHO efficiency function for the duration of their survey, together with the rate of expected events according to the new density profile, we find that the Dark Matter halo could be composed up to $100\%$ of massive compact halo objects for any mass between $10^{-4}$ to $100~M_\odot$, except a broad range around $0.01~M_\odot$, where it cannot be larger than $\sim20~\%$. For the EROS-2 survey, using a modified efficiency curve for consistency with the MACHO analysis, we also find compatibility with a 100\% MACHO halo, but with a tighter constraint around $0.001~M_\odot$ where the halo fraction cannot be larger than $\sim12~\%$. This result assumes that MACHOs all have the same mass.

However, recent studies have shown that quantum measurement itself can induce novel quantum phenomena. One seminal example is a monitored random circuit, which can generate long-range entanglement faster than a random unitary circuit. Inspired by these results, in this paper, we address the following question: When quantum information is encoded in a quantum error-correcting code, how many physical qubits should be randomly measured to destroy the encoded information? We investigate this question for various quantum error-correcting codes and derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for destroying the information through measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that for a large class of quantum error-correcitng codes, it is impossible to destroy the encoded information through random single-qubit Pauli measurements when a tiny portion of physical qubits is still unmeasured. Our results not only reveal the extraordinary robustness of quantum codes under measurement decoherence, but also suggest potential applications in quantum information processing tasks.",{'quantum error-correcting code': 1},02.2024,2024,02,"['Holography', 'Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']"

It is long known how to harness exponential sensitivity to changes in initial conditions for control purposes in classically chaotic systems. In the technique known as targeting, instead of a hindrance to control, the instability becomes a resource. Recently, this classical targeting has been generalized to quantum systems either by periodically countering the inevitable quantum state spreading or by introducing a control Hamiltonian, where both enable localized states to be guided along special chaotic trajectories toward any of a broad variety of desired target states. Only strictly unitary dynamics are involved; i.e., it gives a coherent quantum targeting. In this paper, the introduction of a control Hamiltonian is applied to Bose-Hubbard systems in chaotic dynamical regimes. Properly selected unstable mean field solutions can be followed quite rapidly to states possessing precise phase relationships and occupancies. In essence, the method generates a quantum simulation technique that can access rather special states. The protocol reduces to a time-dependent control of the chemical potentials, opening up the possibility for application in optical lattice experiments.

Constraining black hole parameters with the precessing jet nozzle of M87*,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17689v2,"Shao-Wen Wei, Yuan-Chuan Zou, Yu-Peng Zhang, Yu-Xiao Liu","Recently, Cui et al. [Nature \textbf{621}, 711 (2023)] reported that the jet nozzle of M87* exhibits a precession with a period of approximately 11 years. This finding strongly suggests that M87* is a spinning black hole with a tilted accretion disk. In this paper, our aim is to utilize these observations to constrain the parameters of the black hole. Firstly, we investigate the properties of the tilted circular orbits and the innermost stable circular orbits. The corresponding angular momentum, energy, and Carter constant for both prograde and retrograde orbits are calculated. We find that, compared to equatorial circular orbits, these quantities exhibit significant differences for fixed tilt angles. Moreover, the Carter constant takes positive values for nonvanishing tilt angles. Notably, the presence of misalignment of the orbit angular momentum and black hole spin leads to a precession effect in these tilted circular orbits. We then make use of these circular orbits to model the warp radius of the tilted accretion disk, which allows us to determine the corresponding precession period through the motion of massive particles. Further comparing with the observation of M87*, the relationship between the black hole spin and the warp radius is given, through which if one of them is tested, the other one will be effectively determined. Additionally, our study establishes an upper bound on the warp radius of the accretion disk. These findings demonstrate that the precession of the jet nozzle offers a promising approach for testing the physics of strong gravitational regions near a supermassive black holes.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

The simplest generalization of Maxwell electrodynamics for Lyra manifolds is considered. It is presented an analytic solution for the line element of a Reissner-Nordström LyST generalization. It is shown that, due to the natural presence of a scale radius, it is possible to have three different extremal charges for positive or negative charge intervals. As a consequence, in natural units, the equality of the mass and charge defined on Lyra manifolds does not give rise to an extremal black hole, which allows the existence of solutions in which the charge is greater than the mass. An analysis with charged test particles indicates that a finite positive Lyra scale radius possibly allows for a violation of the weak cosmic censorship on Lyra manifolds, it is shown that an extremal black hole can be overcharged to the point that the emergence of a naked singularity becomes possible.

However, this lower PI boundary is based on the assumption that the star has already lost its hydrogen (H) envelope. With the announcement of an ""impossibly"" heavy BH of 85\,$M_{\odot}$ as part of GW\,190521 located inside the traditional PI gap, we realised that blue supergiant (BSG) progenitors with small cores but large Hydrogen envelopes at low metallicity ($Z$) could directly collapse to heavier BHs than had hitherto been assumed. The question of whether a single star can produce such a heavy BH is important, independent of gravitational wave events. Here, we systematically investigate the masses of stars inside the traditional PI gap by way of a grid of 336 detailed MESA stellar evolution models calculated across a wide parameter space, varying stellar mass, overshooting, rotation, semi-convection, and $Z$. We evolve low $Z$ stars in the range $10^{-3} < Z / Z_{\odot} < Z_{\rm SMC}$, making no prior assumption regarding the mass of an envelope, but instead employing a wind mass loss recipe to calculate it. We compute critical Carbon-Oxygen and Helium core masses to determine our lower limit to PI physics, and we provide two equations for $M_{\text{core}}$ and $M_{\text{final}}$ that can also be of use for binary population synthesis. Assuming the H envelope falls into the BH, we confirm the maximum BH mass below PI is $M_{\text{BH}} \simeq 93.3$ $M_{\odot}$. Our grid allows us to populate the traditional PI gap, and we conclude that the distribution of BHs above the traditional boundary is not solely due to the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), but also to the same stellar interior physics (i.e. mixing) that which sets the BH maximum.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

The monistic pan-unity of the inertial continuum of kinetic energy is quantitatively substantiated by the Lomonosov local push on macroscopic densities in inverse square interactions of visible bodies. The monistic mechanics of inertial fields replaces the dual model of separated particles and their pulling fields or forces at a distance. The positive kinetic pressure of Poincare withstands the metric stress for equilibrium densities and prevents the radial collapse of non-local self-organizations, despite the observed fall of probe (extremely dense) densities in rarefied regions of the correlated continuum of the emerging mass-energy. The four-dimensional geometrization with the inherent sub-symmetries for flat matterspace and adaptive kinetic-metric time can be useful for modeling stationary and auto-pulsing astrosystems, as well as for the modeling of vortex hydrodynamics with non-local feedback and micro-macro-mega-entanglement in the monistic field of quantum inertia.",{'geodesics': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Massive black holes in nuclear star clusters: Investigation with SRG/eROSITA X-ray data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17288v2,"Nils Hoyer, Riccardo Arcodia, Silvia Bonoli, Andrea Merloni, Nadine Neumayer, Yi Zhang, Johan Comparat","Massive black holes (MBHs) are typically hosted in the centres of massive galaxies but they appear to become rarer in lower mass galaxies, where nuclear star clusters (NSCs) frequently appear instead. The transition region, where both an MBH and NSC can co-exist, has been poorly studied to date and only a few dozen galaxies are known to host them. One avenue for detecting new galaxies with both an MBH and NSC is to look for accretion signatures of MBHs. Here, we use new SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey eRASS:4 data to search for X-ray signatures of accreting MBHs in NSCs, while also investigating their combined occupation fraction. We find significant detections for 18 galaxies (~8.3%), including one ultra-luminous X-ray source; however, only three galaxies (NGC2903, 4212, and 4639) have X-ray luminosities that are higher than the expected value from X-ray binaries, indicative of the presence of an MBH. In addition, the X-ray luminosity of six galaxies (NGC2903, 3384, 4321, 4365, 4639, and 4701) differs from previous studies and could indicate the presence of a variable active galactic nucleus. The combined occupation fraction of accreting MBHs and NSCs becomes non-zero for galaxy masses above ~10^7.5 M_sun and this result is slightly elevated as compared to the literature data. Our data extend, for the first time, towards the dwarf elliptical galaxy regime and identify promising MBH candidates for higher resolution follow-up observations. At most galaxy masses (and with the exception of three cases), the X-ray constraints are consistent with the expected emission from binary systems or an Eddington fraction of at most 0.01%, assuming a black holes mass of 10^6.5 M_sun. This work confirms the known complexities in similar-type of studies, while providing the appealing alternative of using X-ray survey data of in-depth observations of individual targets with higher resolution instruments.",{'black holes': 2},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
X-ray AGNs with SRG/eROSITA: Multi-wavelength observations reveal merger triggering and post-coalescence circumnuclear blowout,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17277v1,"Robert W. Bickley, Sara L. Ellison, Mara Salvato, Samir Salim, David R. Patton, Andrea Merloni, Shoshannah Byrne-Mamahit, Leonardo Ferreira, Scott Wilkinson","Major mergers between galaxies are predicted to fuel their central supermassive black holes (SMBHs), particularly after coalescence. However, determining the prevalence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in mergers remains a challenge, because AGN diagnostics are sensitive to details of the central structure (e.g., nuclear gas clouds, geometry and orientation of a dusty torus) that are partly decoupled from SMBH accretion. X-rays, expected to be ubiquitous among accreting systems, are detectable through non-Compton-thick screens of obscuring material, and thus offer the potential for a more complete assessment of AGNs in mergers. But, extant statistical X-ray studies of AGNs in mergers have been limited by either sparse, heterogeneous, or shallow on-sky coverage. We use new X-ray observations from the first SRG/eROSITA all-sky data release to characterize the incidence, luminosity, and observability of AGNs in mergers. Combining machine learning and visual classification, we identify 923 post-mergers in Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) imaging and select 4,565 interacting galaxy pairs (with separations <120 kpc and mass ratios within 1:10) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We find that galaxies with X-ray AGNs are 2.0+/-0.24 times as likely to be identified as post-mergers compared to non-AGN controls, and that post-mergers are 1.8+/-0.1 times as likely to host an X-ray AGN as non-interacting controls. A multi-wavelength census of X-ray, optical, and mid-IR-selected AGNs suggests a picture wherein the underlying AGN fraction increases during pair-phase interactions, that galaxy pairs within ~20 kpc become heavily obscured, and that the obscuration often clears post-coalescence.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we report the discovery of two further galaxies showing QPEs, eRO-QPE3 and eRO-QPE4, with the eROSITA X-ray telescope on board the Spectrum Roentgen Gamma observatory. Among the properties in common with those of known QPEs are: the thermal-like spectral shape in eruption (up to $kT\sim110-120$ eV) and quiescence ($kT\sim50-90$ eV) and its evolution during the eruptions (with a harder rise than decay); the lack of strong canonical signatures of active nuclei (from current optical, UV, infrared and radio data); and the low-mass nature of the host galaxies ($\log M_*\approx 9-10$) and their massive central black holes ($\log M_{\rm BH}\approx 5-7$). These discoveries also bring several new insights into the QPE population: i) eRO-QPE3 shows eruptions on top of a decaying quiescence flux, providing further evidence for a connection between QPEs and a preceding tidal disruption event; ii) eRO-QPE3 exhibits the longest recurrence times and faintest peak luminosity of QPEs, compared to the known QPE population, excluding a correlation between the two; iii) we find evidence, for the first time, of a transient component that is harder, albeit much fainter, than the thermal QPE spectrum in eRO-QPE4; and iv) eRO-QPE4 displays the appearance (or significant brightening) of the quiescence disk component after the detection of QPEs, supporting its short-lived nature against a preexisting active galactic nucleus. Overall, the newly discovered properties (e.g., recent origin and/or transient nature of the quiescent accretion disk; lack of correlation between eruption recurrence timescales and luminosity) are qualitatively consistent with recent models that identify QPEs as extreme mass-ratio inspirals.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Through a systematic set of simulations over a variety of image datasets such as Ants & Bees, CIFAR-10, and Road Sign Detection, we demonstrate the superior performance of our QTL approach over classical and quantum machine learning without involving transfer learning.

Rather than viewing classical and quantum approaches as exclusive alternatives, their integration into hybrid designs has gathered increasing interest, as seen in variational quantum algorithms, quantum circuit learning, and kernel methods. Here we introduce deep hybrid classical-quantum reservoir computing for temporal processing of quantum states where information about, for instance, the entanglement or the purity of past input states can be extracted via a single-step measurement. We find that the hybrid setup cascading two reservoirs not only inherits the strengths of both of its constituents but is even more than just the sum of its parts, outperforming comparable non-hybrid alternatives.

Then, gluing together subsequent time periods, firewalls seem to appear, but they can always be transformed away. At all times we need a Hilbert space of a finite dimension, as long as particles far separated from the black hole are ignored.

Thermodynamic topology of black Holes in f(R) gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16756v3,"Bidyut Hazarika, Prabwal Phukon","In this work, we study the thermodynamic topology of a static, a charged static and a charged, rotating black hole in $f(R)$ gravity. For charged static black holes, we work in two different ensembles: fixed charge$(q)$ ensemble and fixed potential$(φ)$ ensemble. For charged, rotating black hole, four different types of ensembles are considered: fixed $(q, J)$, fixed $(φ, J)$, fixed $(q,Ω)$ and fixed $(φ,Ω)$ ensemble, where $J$ and $Ω$ denotes the angular momentum and the angular frequency respectively. Using the generalized off-shell free energy method, where the black holes are treated as topological defects in their thermodynamic spaces, we investigate the local and global topology of these black holes via the computation of winding numbers at these defects. For static black hole we work in three model. We find that the topological charge for a static black hole is always $-1$ regardless of the values of the thermodynamic parameters and the choice of $f(R)$ model. For a charged static black hole, in the fixed charge ensemble, the topological charge is found to be zero. Contrastingly, in the fixed $φ$ ensemble, the topological charge is found to be $-1.$ For charged static black holes, in both the ensembles, the topological charge is observed to be independent of the thermodynamic parameters. For charged, rotating black hole, in fixed $(q, J)$ ensemble, the topological charge is found to be $1.$ In $(φ, J)$ ensemble, we find the topological charge to be $1.$ In case of fixed $(q,Ω)$ ensemble, the topological charge is $1$ or $0$ depending on the value of the scalar curvature($R$). In fixed $(Ω,φ)$ ensemble, the topological charge is $-1,0$ or $1$ depending on the values of $R,Ω$ and $φ.$",{'black holes': 4},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
A Novel Scalable Quantum Protocol for the Dining Cryptographers Problem,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.16679v1,"Peristera Karananou, Theodore Andronikos","This paper presents an innovative entanglement-based protocol to address the Dining Cryptographers Problem, utilizing maximally entangled $\ket{ GHZ_{ n } }$ tuples as its core. This protocol aims to provide scalability in terms of both the number of cryptographers $n$ and the amount of anonymous information conveyed, represented by the number of qubits $m$ within each quantum register. The protocol supports an arbitrary number of cryptographers $n$, enabling scalability in both participant count and the volume of anonymous information transmitted. While the original Dining Cryptographers Problem focused on a single bit of information, i.e., whether a cryptographer paid for dinner, the proposed protocol allows $m$, the number of qubits in each register, to be any arbitrarily large positive integer. This flexibility permits the conveyance of various information, such as the cost of the dinner or the timing of the arrangement. Another noteworthy aspect of the introduced protocol is its versatility in accommodating both localized and distributed versions of the Dining Cryptographers problem. The localized scenario involves all cryptographers gathering physically at the same location, such as a restaurant, simultaneously. In contrast, the distributed scenario accommodates cryptographers situated in different places, engaging in a virtual dinner at the same time. Finally, in terms of implementation, the protocol ensures uniformity by requiring all cryptographers to utilize identical private quantum circuits. This design establishes a completely modular quantum system where all modules are identical. Furthermore, each private quantum circuit exclusively employs the widely used Hadamard and CNOT quantum gates, facilitating straightforward implementation on contemporary quantum computers.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

In five dimensions we explicitly address the asymptotically flat Myers-Perry black hole and the Kerr-AdS$_5$ black hole. In every case we find that tensor modes contribute $\frac{3}{2} \log T_{\rm Hawking}$ to the low-temperature thermodynamics. We identify the root cause of this universality in two facts: (i) the universal presence of a $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ subgroup of isometries in the near-horizon geometry and (ii) a set of cancellations in the Lichnerowicz operator.

In this work, we demonstrate that stimulated GW radiation can occur within gravitational atoms, which consist of Kerr black holes and the surrounding boson clouds formed through superradiance. The presence of GWs induces mixing between different states of the gravitational atoms, leading to resonant transitions between two states when the GW wavenumber closely matches the energy difference. Consequently, the energy and angular momentum released from these transitions lead to the amplification of GWs, resulting in an exponential increase in the transition rate. Remarkably, the transitions complete within a much shorter time compared to the lifetime of the cloud.

Inspired by neural networks, developing quantum neural networks with specific structures is one of the most promising directions for improving network performance. In this work, we propose a quantum circuit-based algorithm to implement quantum residual neural networks (QResNets), where the residual connection channels are constructed by introducing auxiliary qubits to the data-encoding and trainable blocks of the quantum neural networks.

And the flexibility in adjusting the corresponding Fourier coefficients can also be improved due to the diversity of spectrum construction methods and the additional optimization degrees of freedom in the generalized residual operators. These results indicate that the residual encoding scheme can achieve better spectral richness and enhance the expressivity of various parameterized quantum circuits.

Taylor","The capability of holography to project three-dimensional (3D) images and correct for aberrations offers much potential to enhance optical control in light-based 3D printing. Notably, multi-beam multi-wavelength holographic systems represent an important development direction for advanced volumetric additive manufacturing (VAM). Nonetheless, searching for the optimal 3D holographic projection is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the physical constraints involved. This work introduces an optimization framework to search for the optimal set of projection parameters, namely phase modulation values and amplitudes, for multi-beam holographic lithography. The proposed framework is more general than classical phase retrieval algorithms in the sense that it can simultaneously optimize multiple holographic beams and model the coupled non-linear material response created by co-illumination of the holograms. The framework incorporates efficient methods to evaluate holographic light fields, resample quantities across coordinate grids, and compute the coupled exposure effect. The efficacy of this optimization method is tested for a variety of setup configurations that involve multi-wavelength illumination, two-photon absorption, and time-multiplexed scanning beam. A special test case of holo-tomographic patterning optimized 64 holograms simultaneously and achieved the lowest error among all demonstrations. This variant of tomographic VAM shows promises for achieving high-contrast microscale fabrication. All testing results indicate that a fully coupled optimization offers superior solutions relative to a decoupled optimization approach.",{'holography': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Dirichlet boundary conditions are chosen for the fermions. Quantum fluctuations of the geometry are included by summing over all possible triangulations consistent with these constraints. We show in the limit $N\to \infty$ that the partition function is dominated by a regular triangulation of two dimensional hyperbolic space. We use strong coupling expansions and Monte Carlo simulation to show that in this limit boundary correlators of the fermions have a power law dependence on boundary separation as one expects from holography. However we argue that this behavior breaks down for any finite number of massive fields in the thermodynamic limit and quantum fluctuations of the bulk geometry drive the theory into a non-holographic phase. In contrast, for massless fermions we find evidence that the boundary is conformal even for finite $N$. This is consistent with theoretical results in quantum Liouville theory.","{'bulk geometry': 1, 'holography': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Non-parametric Greedy Optimization of Parametric Quantum Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15442v1,"Koustubh Phalak, Swaroop Ghosh","The use of Quantum Neural Networks (QNN) that are analogous to classical neural networks, has greatly increased in the past decade owing to the growing interest in the field of Quantum Machine Learning (QML). A QNN consists of three major components: (i) data loading/encoding circuit, (ii) Parametric Quantum Circuit (PQC), and (iii) measurement operations. Under ideal circumstances the PQC of the QNN trains well, however that may not be the case for training under quantum hardware due to presence of different kinds of noise. Deeper QNNs with high depths tend to degrade more in terms of performance compared to shallower networks. This work aims to reduce depth and gate count of PQCs by replacing parametric gates with their approximate fixed non-parametric representations. We propose a greedy algorithm to achieve this such that the algorithm minimizes a distance metric based on unitary transformation matrix of original parametric gate and new set of non-parametric gates. From this greedy optimization followed by a few epochs of re-training, we observe roughly 14% reduction in depth and 48% reduction in gate count at the cost of 3.33% reduction in inferencing accuracy.

Quasibound state reminiscent in de-Sitter black holes: Quasinormal modes and the decay of massive fields,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15156v1,"Mateus M. Corrêa, Caio F. B. Macedo, João L.

In asymptotically de-Sitter spacetimes, however, the massive perturbations always leak to the cosmological horizon, which indicates the absence of a quasibound part of the spectrum. In this work, we show that an additional mode exists in asymptotically de-Sitter black holes that produces an imprint similar to that of the quasibound states in the late-time behavior of massive scalar perturbations. If the Compton wavelength is larger than a certain critical value (which depends on the cosmological constant), the oscillatory behavior of the tail turns into an exponential decay due to the fact that the de-Sitter mode is purely imaginary. Even for black holes with typical length scales small in comparison to the size of the cosmological horizon, the late-time tail behavior of the massive perturbations is modified as compared to the usual $t^{-5/6}$ for Schwarzschild black holes, thus being a distinctive feature induced by the presence of a cosmological constant.",{'black holes': 4},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

It was shown that the presence of fluctuations with wavelength much larger than the characteristic scales of the surveys has no impact on cosmological probes, if the matter content is adiabatic and the Einstein equations are used. In this paper we study the sensitivity of cosmological probes to infrared fluctuations in Horndeski theory. We find that the extra degree of freedom in the Horndeski scalar field can induce sensitivity to infrared fluctuations in the cosmological probes, even when the matter components are adiabatic on large scales. A generalized adiabatic condition including the extra dof, in contrast, guarantees that cosmological probes are devoid of infrared sensitivity, and this solution corresponds to the adiabatic modes à la Weinberg in Horndeski theory, which can be removed by a coordinate transformation in the infrared limit.

This work provides the horizon structure, photon radius and inner stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a mass particle with EYM BH parameters. An analysis is provided of the effective potential as well as the possible orbits for test particles under various EYM BH parameters values. In timelike radial geodesics, we find that for smaller values of magnetic charge, particles following a timelike radial geodesic are hastier in EYM BH, and hence arrive at the center faster than those traveling a Schwarzschild BH geodesic. However, at larger values of the magnetic charge, the inverse effect is observed. The effect of model parameters is investigated in order to study the ISCO, photon radius, orbit stability (Lyapunov exponent), and effective force on particles for the BH in the EYM theory.

Our investigation reveals that the shadows of LQG modified black holes are smaller and brighter than Schwarzschild black holes. To examine the impact of the quantum correction on the quasinormal mode, linear-quadratic GUP modified black holes are explored under scalar and electromagnetic field perturbation. Here, linear-quadratic GUP is used to capture quantum corrections. It is observed that the incorporation of quantum correction by linear-quadratic GUP alters the singularity structure of the black hole. To compute the quasinormal modes of this linear-quadratic GUP-inspired quantum-corrected black holes, we compute the effective potential generated under the perturbation of scalar and electromagnetic field, and then we use the sixth-order WKB approach in conjunction with the appropriate numerical analysis. We find that the greybody factor decreases with the GUP parameter $α$ implying that the probability of transmission decreases with the GUP parameter.

More importantly, we also found rapid changes in the recurrence time $T_\text{recur}$ of the X-ray flares by modelling the long-term X-ray light curve of J0456-20. $T_\text{recur}$ first decreased rapidly from about 300 days to around 230 days.

Hard Attention Mechanism (HAM), anticipated to efficiently tackle the above QML bottlenecks, encounters the substantial challenge of non-differentiability, consequently constraining its extensive applicability. In response to the dilemma of HAM and QML, a Grover-inspired Quantum Hard Attention Mechanism (GQHAM) consisting of a Flexible Oracle (FO) and an Adaptive Diffusion Operator (ADO) is proposed. Notably, the FO is designed to surmount the non-differentiable issue by executing the activation or masking of Discrete Primitives (DPs) with Flexible Control (FC) to weave various discrete destinies. Based on this, such discrete choice can be visualized with a specially defined Quantum Hard Attention Score (QHAS). Furthermore, a trainable ADO is devised to boost the generality and flexibility of GQHAM.

Experimental findings demonstrate that GQHAN adeptly surmounts the non-differentiability hurdle, surpassing the efficacy of extant quantum soft self-attention mechanisms in accuracies and learning ability. In noise experiments, GQHAN is robuster to bit-flip noise in accuracy and amplitude damping noise in learning performance. Predictably, the proposal of GQHAN enriches the Quantum Attention Mechanism (QAM), lays the foundation for future quantum computers to process large-scale data, and promotes the development of quantum computer vision.","{'quantum computer': 1, 'quantum machine learning': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Retrograde thick disks around boson stars and the influence of strong magnetic fields on them were already studied and it was shown that they can harbor very distinct features compared to black hole disks. However, the case of prograde thick disks is mostly unexplored, since they may appear much more similar to black hole disks. In this work we will investigate similarities and differences regarding prograde thick disks around non-selfinteracting rotating boson stars and rotating black holes. We assume thereby a polytropic equation of state and a constant specific angular momentum distribution of the disks. We classify the various conceivable boson star and black hole solutions by a dimensionless spin parameter $a$ and compare their corresponding disk solutions. The influence of toroidal magnetic fields on the disks is analyzed by selected disk properties, as the rest-mass density distribution and the Bernoulli parameter. Disk solutions are characterized by their degree of magnetization represented by the magnetization parameter $β_{mc}$. We found that strong magnetic fields can strengthen the differences of disk solutions or oppositely even lead to a correlation in disk properties, depending on the spin parameter of the boson star and black hole solutions.

Here, we use the high resolution and sensitivity of JWST to measure the host galaxy properties for 61 X-ray-selected type-I AGNs at $0.7<z<2.5$ with rest-frame optical/near-infrared imaging from COSMOS-Web and PRIMER. Black hole masses ($\log\left(M_{\rm BH}/M_\odot\right)\sim7.5-9.5$) are available from previous spectroscopic campaigns. We extract the host galaxy components from four NIRCam broadband images and the HST/ACS F814W image by applying a 2D image decomposition technique. We detect the host galaxy for $\sim90\%$ of the sample after subtracting the unresolved AGN emission. With host photometry free of AGN emission, we determine the stellar mass of the host galaxies to be $\log\left(M_*/M_\odot\right)\sim10-11.5$ through SED fitting and measure the evolution of the mass relation between SMBHs and their host galaxies. Considering selection biases and measurement uncertainties, we find that the $M_\mathrm{ BH}/M_*$ ratio evolves as $\left(1+z\right)^{0.37_{-0.60}^{+0.35}}$ thus remains essentially constant or exhibits mild evolution up to $z\sim2.5$. We also see an amount of scatter ($σ_μ=0.28\pm0.13$) is similar to the local relation and consistent with low-$z$ studies; this appears to not rule out non-causal cosmic assembly where mergers contribute to the statistical averaging towards the local relation.

Entanglement growth from squeezing on the MPS manifold,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13740v1,"Sebastian Leontica, Andrew G. Green","Finding suitable characterizations of quantum chaos is a major challenge in many-body physics, with a central difficulty posed by the linearity of the Schrödinger equation. A possible solution for recovering non-linearity is to project the dynamics onto some variational manifold. The classical chaos induced via this procedure may be used as a signature of quantum chaos in the full Hilbert space. Here, we demonstrate analytically a previously heuristic connection between the Lyapunov spectrum from projection onto the matrix product state (MPS) manifold and the growth of entanglement. This growth occurs by squeezing a localized distribution on the variational manifold. The process qualitatively resembles the Cardy-Calabrese picture, where local perturbations to a moving MPS reference are interpreted as bosonic quasi-particles. Taking careful account of the number of distinct channels for these processes recovers the connection to the Lyapunov spectrum. Our results rigorously establish the physical significance of the projected Lyapunov spectrum, suggesting it as an alternative method of characterizing chaos in quantum many-body systems, one that is manifestly linked to classical chaos.","{'matrix product state': 1, 'quantum chaos': 2}",01.2024,2024,01,[]
A measure of chaos from eigenstate thermalization hypothesis,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13633v1,Nilakash Sorokhaibam,"Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis is a detailed statement of the matrix elements of few-body operators in energy eigenbasis of a chaotic Hamiltonian. Part of the statement is that the off-diagonal elements fall exponential for large energy difference. We propose that the exponent ($γ>0$) is a measure of quantum chaos. Smaller $γ$ implies more chaotic dynamics. The chaos bound is given by $γ=β/4$ where $β$ is the inverse temperature. We give analytical argument in support of this proposal. The slower exponential fall also means that the action of the operator on a state leads to higher delocalization in energy eigenbasis. Numerically we compare two chaotic Hamiltonians - SYK model and chaotic XXZ spin chain. Using the new measure, we find that the SYK model becomes maximally chaotic at low temperature which has been shown rigorously in previous works.

Transport and information in open quantum systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.13292v1,Kasper Poulsen,"With the approaching second quantum revolution, the study of quantum thermodynamics, particularly heat flow, has become even more relevant for two main reasons. First, understanding heat and other types of noise is essential for protecting quantum information and preventing decoherence. Second, the ability to manufacture and control quantum systems developed for the quantum computer allows for experimental study of quantum thermodynamics in entirely new settings.
  In this thesis, several systems involving quantum systems in contact with baths are studied theoretically in experimentally available settings. First, two rectification or diode setups for heat currents are proposed using a dark-state mechanism. In one system, the dark-state mechanism is imperfect but very robust. In the other system, the dark-state mechanism relies on quantum entanglement and is much better but more fragile towards decoherence. Next, a quantum version of the Wheatstone bridge is built using the same entanglement-powered dark state mechanism. After having studied several boundary-driven quantum systems, the lessons learned are generalized into resonance conditions using a general linear chain of weakly interacting chains of strongly interacting spins.
  The final two chapters focus on the ability to study statistical physics in realizable quantum systems. First, a Maxwell's demon setup is proposed. A demon-controlled qutrit is coupled to two non-Markovian baths. The information back-flow from the non-Markovian baths allows the demon to more effectively transfer heat from the cold bath to the hot bath. Second, the Mott insulator to superfluid phase transition in a lattice of transmons is examined. The ground state has a variable particle number and is prepared using adiabatic state preparation. This allows for the exploration of the entire phase diagram.",{'quantum computer': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Chen, Joel Leja, Qingling Ni, Guang Yang","A fundamental question in galaxy and black-hole evolution remains how galaxies and their supermassive black holes have evolved together over cosmic time. Specifically, it is still unclear how the position of X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies with respect to the star-forming main sequence (MS) may change with the X-ray luminosity ($L_\mathrm{X}$) of the AGN or the stellar mass ($M_\star$) of the host galaxy. We use data from XMM-SERVS to probe this issue. XMM-SERVS is covered by the largest medium-depth X-ray survey (with superb supporting multiwavelength data) and thus contains the largest sample to date for study. To ensure consistency, we locally derive the MS from a large reference galaxy sample. In our analysis, we demonstrate that the turnover of the galaxy MS does not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn for high-mass AGNs, and we establish a robust safe regime where the results do not depend upon the choice of MS definition. Under this framework, our results indicate that less-massive AGN host-galaxies ($\log M_\star\sim9.5-10.5$ $M_\odot$) generally possess enhanced SFRs compared to their normal-galaxy counterparts while the more-massive AGN host galaxies ($\log M_\star\sim10.5-11.5$ $M_\odot$) lie on or below the star-forming MS. Further, we propose an empirical model for how the placement of an AGN with respect to the MS (SFR$_{norm}$) evolves as a function of both $M_\star$ and $L_\mathrm{X}$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Our approach is inspired by the treatment of the near-horizon geometry of extremal black holes in the physics literature.

It is also well-known that the effect of non-linearities can be significant in both phenomena. In this paper, we advocate the existence of a general single-field consistency relation that relates the amplitude of non-Gaussianity in the squeezed limit $f_{\text{NL}}$ to the power spectrum and remains valid when almost all other consistency relations are violated. In particular, it is suitable for studying scenarios where scale invariance is strongly violated. We discuss the general and model-independent consequences of the consistency relation on the behavior of $f_{\text{NL}}$ at different scales. Specifically, we study the size, sign and slope of $f_{\text{NL}}$ at the scales where the power spectrum peaks and argue that generally the peaks of $f_{\text{NL}}$ and the power spectrum occur at different scales. As an implication of our results, we argue that non-linearities can shift or extend the range of scales responsible for the production of PBHs or GWs, relative to the window as determined by the largest peak of the power spectrum, and may also open up new windows for both phenomena.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

As a consequence, it is not sufficient to rely solely on the analysis of such scalars to assess the regularity of a given space-time. This conclusion follows from the analysis of incomplete geodesics within the internal region of asymmetric wormholes supported by scalar matter which arise in two distinct metric-affine gravity theories. These wormholes have bounded algebraic curvature scalars everywhere, which highlights that their finiteness does not prevent the emergence of pathologies (singularities) in the geodesic structure of space-time. By analyzing the tidal forces in the internal wormhole region, we find that the angular components are unbounded along incomplete radial time-like geodesics. The strength of the singularity is determined by the evolution of Jacobi fields along such geodesics, finding that it is of strong type, as volume elements are torn apart as the singularity is approached.

Time-multiplexed holography creates different speckle patterns over time and then averages them to achieve a speckle-free 3D display. However, this approach requires spatial light modulators (SLMs) with ultra-fast refresh rates, and current algorithms cannot update holograms at such speeds.

Our NIRSpec/IFU observations spatially resolve the emission line properties across the host galaxy in great detail. We find at least five concentrations of line emission, coinciding with discrete continuum features previously detected in imaging from HST and JWST, over an extent of ~2'' (~15 kpc). The spectral diagnostics enabled by NIRSpec unambiguously trace the activity of the obscured AGN plus interaction between the interstellar medium and the radio jet as the dominant mechanisms for the ionization state and kinematics of the gas in the system. A secondary region of very high ionization lies at roughly 5 kpc distance from the nucleus, and within the context of an expanding cocoon enveloping the radio lobe, this may be explained by strong shock-ionization of the entrained gas. However, it could also signal the presence of a second obscured AGN, which may also offer an explanation for an intriguing outflow feature seen perpendicular to the radio axis. The presence of a dual SMBH system in this galaxy would support that large galaxies in the early Universe quickly accumulated their mass through the merging of smaller units (each with their own SMBH), at the centers of large overdensities.

Information Problem in Black Holes and Cosmology and Ghosts in Quadratic Gravity,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12191v1,Igor Volovich,"Black hole information problem is the question about unitarity of the evolution operator during the collapse and evaporation of the black hole. One can ask the same question about unitarity of quantum and inflationary cosmology. In this paper we argue that in both cases, for black holes and for cosmology, the answer is negative and we face non-unitarity.
  Such a question can not be addressed by using the fixed classical gravitational background since one has to take into account the backreaction. To his end one uses the semi-classical gravity, which includes the expectation value of the energy - momentum tensor operator of the matter fields. One has to renormalize the energy-momentum tensor and one gets an effective action which contains quadratic terms in scalar curvature and Ricci tensor. Such quadratic gravity contains ghosts which in fact lead to violation of unitarity in black holes and cosmology. We discuss the question whether black holes will emit ghosts.
  One can try to restrict ourselves to the $f(R)$ gravity that seems is a good approximation to the semi-classical gravity and widely used in cosmology. The black hole entropy in $f(R)$ gravity is different from the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy and from entanglement island entropy. The black hole entropy in $R+R^2$ gravity goes to a constant during the evaporation process.

Probing the Spin-Induced Quadrupole Moment of Massive Black Holes with the Inspiral of Binary Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12066v1,"Ying-Lin Kong, Jian-dong Zhang","One of the most important sources for the space-borne gravitational wave detectors such as TianQin and LISA, is the merger of massivie black hole binaries. Using the inspiral signals, we can probe the properties of the massive black holes, such as the spin-induced multipole moments. By verifying the relation among the mass, spin and quadrupole moment, the no-hair theoreom can be tested. In this work, we analysed the capability on probing the spin-induced quadrupole moment with the inspiral signal of massive black hole binaries using space-borne gravitational wave detectors. Using the Fisher information matrix, we find that the deviation of quadrupole moment can be constrained to the level of $10^{-1}$, and the events with higher mass-ratio will give a better constraint. We also find that the late inspiral part will dominate the result of parameter estimation. The result of Bayesian analysis shows that the capability will be improved by a few times due to the consideration of higher modes. We also calculate the Bayes factor, and the results indicate that the model of black hole and Boson star can be distinguished undoubtedly.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Quantum Characteristics Near Event Horizons,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.12028v1,"A. Ali, S. Al-Kuwari, M. Ghominejad, M. T. Rahim, S.

We consider and analyze different scenarios based on how many particles are accessible. In each scenario, we evaluate first-order coherence, concurrence fill, and global concurrence under varying Hawking temperature and Dirac particle mode frequency. For the fully accessible scenario with all particles outside the event horizon, the measures exhibit non-monotonic behavior with a discernible trade-off. In the partially accessible scenarios with one particle inside the event horizon, monotonic variations and clear trade-offs are observed. Finally, in the scenario when two particles are inside the event horizon, concurrence fill becomes complex, attributed to the violation of the entanglement polygon inequality in curved space-time. This result reveals intricate relationships between entanglement and coherence around the event horizon of Schwarzchild black holes. Our findings suggest reevaluating entanglement polygon inequalities and concurrence fill for applicability in flat and curved space-times.

These candidates were selected by harnessing the rich multiband datasets provided by the emerging JWST-driven extragalactic surveys, focusing on COSMOS-Web, as well as JADES, UNCOVER, CEERS, and PRIMER. Our search strategy includes two stages: applying stringent photometric cuts to catalog-level data and detailed spectral energy distribution fitting. These techniques effectively isolate the quasar candidates while mitigating contamination from low-redshift interlopers, such as brown dwarfs and nearby galaxies. The selected candidates indicate physical traits compatible with low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, likely hosting $\approx10^5$--$10^7~M_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs) living in galaxies with stellar masses of $\approx10^8$--$10^{10}~M_\odot$. The SMBHs selected in this study, on average, exhibit an elevated mass compared to their hosts, with the mass ratio distribution slightly higher than those of galaxies in the local Universe. As with other high-$z$ studies, this is at least in part due to the selection method for these quasars. An extensive Monte Carlo analysis provides compelling evidence that heavy black hole seeds from the direct collapse scenario appear to be the preferred pathway to mature this specific subset of SMBHs by $z\approx7$.

The conventional GFMC method, widely used to find the ground state of a quantum many-body system, is plagued by the sign problem, which leads to an exponentially increasing variance with the growth of system size and evolution time. This issue is typically mitigated by applying classical constraints but at the cost of introducing bias. Our approach uses quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) on a quantum computer to prepare a quantum trial state, replacing the classical trial state in the GFMC process. We also incorporated a modified classical shadow technique in the implementation of QSD to optimize quantum resource utilization.

Moving Interfaces and two-dimensional Black Holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11451v1,"Parthajit Biswas, Suchetan Das, Anirban Dinda","Conformal field theories can exchange energy through a boundary interface. Imposing conformal boundary conditions for static interfaces implies energy conservation at the interface. Recently, the reflective and transmitive properties of such static conformal interfaces have been studied in two dimensions by scattering matter at the interface impurity. In this note, we generalize this to the case of dynamic interfaces. Motivated by the connections between the moving mirror and the black hole, we choose a particular profile for the dynamical interface. We show that a part of the total energy of each side will be lost in the interface. In other words, a time-dependent interface can accumulate or absorb energy. While, in general, the interface follows a time-like trajectory, one can take a particular limit of a profile parameter($β$), such that the interface approaches a null line asymptotically$(β\rightarrow 0)$. In this limit, we show that for a class of boundary conditions, the interface behaves like a `semipermeable membrane'. We also consider another set of conformal boundary conditions for which, in the null line limit, the interface mimics the properties expected of a horizon. In this case, we devise a scattering experiment, where (zero-point subtracted) energy from one CFT is fully transmitted to the other CFT, while from the other CFT, energy can neither be transmitted nor reflected, i.e., it gets lost in the interface. This boundary condition is also responsible for the thermal energy spectrum which mimics Hawking radiation. This is analogous to the black hole where the horizon plays the role of a one-sided `membrane', which accumulates all the interior degrees of freedom and radiates thermally in the presence of quantum fluctuation. Stimulated by this observation, we comment on some plausible construction of wormhole analogues.",{'hawking radiation': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we revisit the AGN contribution to reionization given the high number densities associated with these objects. We use the DELPHI semi-analytic model, base-lined against the latest high-redshift datasets from the JWST and the Atacama Large millimetre Array (ALMA) to model early star forming galaxies and AGN. We calculate the escape fractions of ionizing radiation from both star formation and AGN and include the impact of reionization feeback in suppressing the baryonic content of low-mass galaxies in ionized regions. This model is validated against the key observables for star forming galaxy, AGN and reionization. In our {\it fiducial} model, reionization reaches its mid-point at $z \sim 6.9$ and ends by $z \sim 5.9$. Low stellar mass ($M_*\leq 10^9M_\odot$) star forming galaxies are found to be the key drivers of the reionization process, providing about $77\%$ of the total photon budget. Despite their high numbers, high accretion rates and higher escape fractions compared to star forming galaxies at $z \sim 5$, AGN only provide about $23\%$ of the total reionization budget which is dominated by black holes in high stellar mass systems (with $M_* \geq 10^9M_\odot$). This is because AGN number densities become relevant only at $z \leq 7$ - as a result, AGN contribute as much as galaxies as late as $z \sim 6.2$, when reionization is already in its end stages. Finally, we find that even contrasting models of the AGN ionizing photon escape fraction (increasing or decreasing with stellar mass) do not qualitatively change our results.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

In this work, we apply scalar and vector quantization to Schrödinger-style quantum circuit simulations as lossy compression schemes to reduce the number of bits needed to simulate quantum circuits. Using quantization, we can maintain simulation fidelities $>0.99$ when simulating the Quantum Fourier Transform, while using only 7 significand bits in a floating-point number to characterize the real and imaginary components of each amplitude. Furthermore, using vector quantization, we propose a method to bound the number of bits/amplitude needed to store state vectors in a simulation of a circuit that achieves a desired fidelity, and show that for a 6 qubit simulation of the Quantum Fourier Transform, 15 bits/amplitude is sufficient to maintain fidelity $>0.9$ at $10^4$ depth.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

We have considered the family of C-metric accelerating black holes and evaluated their corresponding gravitational entropy. Then we studied the GE in some isotropic and anisotropic cosmologies utilizing the definition proposed by Clifton, Ellis, and Tavakol, where the Bel-Robinson tensor is used to determine the energy-momentum tensor of the free gravitational field. We checked whether, in the vicinity of the initial cosmic singularity, the ratio of the energy density of free gravity to that of matter density goes to zero or not. We showed that whenever this is true, the gravitational entropy increases monotonically with the structure formation of the universe and discussed the conditions of validity for the Weyl curvature hypothesis. Subsequently, the next part of the thesis deals with the validity of two different proposals of gravitational entropy (GE) in traversable wormhole systems. We found that the GE proposals do provide us with a consistent measure of GE in several wormhole solutions. In the later portion of the thesis, we examined the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics (GSLT) in an expanding FRW universe filled with different variants of the Chaplygin gas.

The metasurfaces employing the Pancharatnam-Berry (PB) geometric phase, called PB metasurfaces, have been extensively applied to realize spin-dependent functionalities, such as beam steering, focusing, holography, etc. The demand for PB metasurfaces in complex environments has brought about one challenging problem, i.e., the interference of multiple wave channels that limits the performance of PB metasurfaces. A promising solution is developing nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces that can isolate undesired wave channels and exhibit unidirectional functionalities. Here, we propose a mechanism to realize nonreciprocal PB metasurfaces of subwavelength thickness by using the magneto-optical effect of YIG material in synergy with the PB geometric phase of spatially rotating meta-atoms.

In this framework, we study in full generality energy conditions near the matching surface. As a result, we found that, after imposing the vanishing of the energy density $E$ at the matching surface, if weak and dominant energy conditions (WEC,DEC) are satisfied, then unavoidable strong energy conditions is violated, i.e. near the event horizon only matter with dark energy-like features is allowed.

Scaling Relations of Spectrum Form Factor and Krylov Complexity at Finite Temperature,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10499v1,"Chengming Tan, Zhiyang Wei, Ren Zhang","In the study of quantum chaos diagnostics, considerable attention has been attributed to the Krylov complexity and spectrum form factor (SFF) for systems at infinite temperature. These investigations have unveiled universal properties of quantum chaotic systems. By extending the analysis to include the finite temperature effects on the Krylov complexity and SFF, we demonstrate that the Lanczos coefficients $b_n$, which are associated with the Wightman inner product, display consistency with the universal hypothesis presented in PRX 9, 041017 (2019). This result contrasts with the behavior of Lanczos coefficients associated with the standard inner product. Our results indicate that the slope $α$ of the $b_n$ is bounded by $πk_BT$, where $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant and $T$ the temperature. We also investigate the SFF, which characterizes the two-point correlation of the spectrum and encapsulates an indicator of ergodicity denoted by $g$ in chaotic systems. Our analysis demonstrates that as the temperature decreases, the value of $g$ decreases as well. Considering that $α$ also represents the operator growth rate, we establish a quantitative relationship between ergodicity indicator and Lanczos coefficients slope. To support our findings, we provide evidence using the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble and a random spin model.

Dynamical Property of Black Hole Matter,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10477v1,C. S. Lam,"Matter loses its original characteristics after entering a black hole, thus becoming a new kind of (black hole) matter. The property of this new matter cannot be measured experimentally, but some of it can be deduced theoretically from the Einstein equations and the conservation laws which it must still satisfy. In a previous paper, this matter is modelled by an ideal fluid, with an equation of state $p(r)=-ξ\r(r)$ between the pressure $p(r)$ and the density $ρ(r)$. In order for this matter to fill the inside of a black hole so that its property can be teased out from the Einstein and conservation equations, it must possess a negative pressure ($ξ>0$) to counter the gravitation attraction which draws all matter to the center. In that case a solution of the Einstein and conservation equations exists if and only if the constant $ξ$ is confined within a narrow range, between 0.1429 and 0.1716. In the present paper, we try to find out its dynamical response by injecting additional matter into the black hole over a period of time. The resulting solutions of the six time-dependent Einstein equations and conservation laws are presented in perturbation theory, valid if the total amount of injection is small. Even in perturbation, the solutions can be obtained only with a special trick. The result shows that the equation of state $p(r,t)=-ξ\r(r,t)$ remains unchanged with the same $ξ$ when the injection rate is constant. When the rate changes with time, $ξ$ requires a correction, $ξ\toξ+ξ_1(r,t)$, where $ξ_1(r,t)$ appears to be correlated with the acceleration of the injected matter in a way to be shown in the text.",{'einstein equations': 2},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

The action is linearized in the Weyl scalar by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and thus it can be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. In static spherical symmetry, this theory admits an exact black hole solution, which generalizes the standard Schwarzschild-de Sitter solution through the presence of two new terms in the metric, having a linear and a quadratic dependence on the radial coordinate, respectively. The solution is obtained by assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component. After studying the locations of the event and cosmological horizons of the Weyl geometric black hole, we investigate in detail the thermodynamical (quantum properties) of this type of black holes, by considering the Hawking temperature, the volume, the entropy, specific heat and the Helmholtz and Gibbs energy functions on both the event and the cosmological horizons.

The algorithm avoids sample repetition and, thus, is efficient at sampling distribution with exponentially decaying tails. We illustrate the computational advantage provided by our optimal sampling method through various numerical examples, involving condensed matter, optimization problems, and quantum circuit scenarios.

Quantum State Obfuscation from Classical Oracles,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10200v1,"James Bartusek, Zvika Brakerski, Vinod Vaikuntanathan","A major unresolved question in quantum cryptography is whether it is possible to obfuscate arbitrary quantum computation. Indeed, there is much yet to understand about the feasibility of quantum obfuscation even in the classical oracle model, where one is given for free the ability to obfuscate any classical circuit.
  In this work, we develop a new array of techniques that we use to construct a quantum state obfuscator, a powerful notion formalized recently by Coladangelo and Gunn (arXiv:2311.07794) in their pursuit of better software copy-protection schemes. Quantum state obfuscation refers to the task of compiling a quantum program, consisting of a quantum circuit $C$ with a classical description and an auxiliary quantum state $\ketψ$, into a functionally-equivalent obfuscated quantum program that hides as much as possible about $C$ and $\ketψ$. We prove the security of our obfuscator when applied to any pseudo-deterministic quantum program, i.e. one that computes a (nearly) deterministic classical input / classical output functionality. Our security proof is with respect to an efficient classical oracle, which may be heuristically instantiated using quantum-secure indistinguishability obfuscation for classical circuits.
  Our result improves upon the recent work of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023) who also showed how to obfuscate pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits in the classical oracle model, but only ones with a completely classical description. Furthermore, our result answers a question of Coladangelo and Gunn, who provide a construction of quantum state indistinguishability obfuscation with respect to a quantum oracle. Indeed, our quantum state obfuscator together with Coladangelo-Gunn gives the first candidate realization of a ``best-possible'' copy-protection scheme for all polynomial-time functionalities.",{'quantum circuit': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

To linear order, we verify that the scalar field evolves stably, decaying in different towers of quasinormal modes. The studied black holes are either charged geometries (regular and singular) or a regular Bañados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ)-like black hole, both coming from the EM-GQT theory characterized by nonminimal coupling parameters between gravity and a background scalar field. We calculate the quasinormal modes applying different numerical methods with convergent results between them. The oscillations demonstrate a very peculiar structure for charged black holes: in the intermediate and near extremal cases, a particular scaling arises, similar to that of the rotating BTZ geometry, with the modes being proportional to the distance between horizons. For the single horizon black hole solution, we identify the presence of different quasinormal families by analyzing the features of that spectrum.

Shankar","Supermassive black holes require a reservoir of cold gas at the centre of their host galaxy in order to accrete and shine as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Major mergers have the ability to drive gas rapidly inwards, but observations trying to link mergers with AGN have found mixed results due to the difficulty of consistently identifying galaxy mergers in surveys. This study applies deep learning to this problem, using convolutional neural networks trained to identify simulated post-merger galaxies from survey-realistic imaging. This provides a fast and repeatable alternative to human visual inspection. Using this tool, we examine a sample of ~8500 Seyfert 2 galaxies (L[OIII] ~ $10^{38.5 - 42}$ erg/s) at z < 0.3 in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and find a merger fraction of $2.19_{-0.17}^{+0.21}$% compared with inactive control galaxies, in which we find a merger fraction of $2.96_{-0.20}^{+0.26}$%, indicating an overall lack of mergers among AGN hosts compared with controls. However, matching the controls to the AGN hosts in stellar mass and star formation rate reveals that AGN hosts in the star-forming blue cloud exhibit a ~$2\times$ merger enhancement over controls, while those in the quiescent red sequence have significantly lower relative merger fractions, leading to the observed overall deficit due to the differing $M_{\ast} - $SFR distributions. We conclude that while mergers are not the dominant trigger of all low-luminosity, obscured AGN activity in the nearby Universe, they are more important to AGN fuelling in galaxies with higher cold gas mass fractions as traced through star formation.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Entanglement cost for infinite-dimensional physical systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09554v1,"Hayata Yamasaki, Kohdai Kuroiwa, Patrick Hayden, Ludovico Lami","We prove that the entanglement cost equals the regularized entanglement of formation for any infinite-dimensional quantum state $ρ_{AB}$ with finite quantum entropy on at least one of the subsystems $A$ or $B$. This generalizes a foundational result in quantum information theory that was previously formulated only for operations and states on finite-dimensional systems. The extension to infinite dimensions is nontrivial because the conventional tools for establishing both the direct and converse bounds, i.e., strong typically, monotonicity, and asymptotic continuity, are no longer directly applicable. To address this problem, we construct a new entanglement dilution protocol for infinite-dimensional states implementable by local operations and a finite amount of one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC), using weak and strong typicality multiple times. We also prove the optimality of this protocol among all protocols even under infinite-dimensional separable operations by developing an argument based on alternative forms of monotonicity and asymptotic continuity of the entanglement of formation for infinite-dimensional states. Along the way, we derive a new integral representation for the quantum entropy of infinite-dimensional states, which we believe to be of independent interest.

On the Holographic Dual of a Topological Symmetry Operator,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.09538v1,"Jonathan J. Heckman, Max Hübner, Chitraang Murdia","We study the holographic dual of a topological symmetry operator in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence. Symmetry operators arise from topological field theories localized on a subspace of the boundary CFT spacetime. We use bottom up considerations to construct the topological sector associated with their bulk counterparts. In particular, by exploiting the structure of entanglement wedge reconstruction we argue that the bulk counterpart has a non-topological worldvolume action, i.e., it describes a dynamical object. As a consequence, we find that there are no global $p$-form symmetries for $p \geq 0$ in asymptotically AdS spacetimes, which includes the case of non-invertible symmetries. Provided one has a suitable notion of subregion-subregion duality, our argument for the absence of bulk global symmetries applies to more general spacetimes. These considerations also motivate us to consider for general QFTs (holographic or not) the notion of lower-form symmetries, namely, $(-m)$-form symmetries for $m \geq 2$.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Bhupal Dev, Anish Ghoshal","We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from density fluctuations due to supercooled phase transitions (PTs) triggered in an axion-like particle (ALP) model. We find that the mass of the PBHs is inversely correlated with the ALP decay constant $f_a$. For instance, for $f_a$ varying from ${\cal O}$(100 MeV) to ${\cal O}$($10^{12}$ GeV), the PBH mass varies between $(10^{3} - 10^{-24}) M_{\odot}$. We then identify the ALP parameter space where the PBH can account for the entire (or partial) dark matter fraction of the Universe, in a single (multi-component) dark matter scenario, with the ALP being the other dark matter candidate. The PBH parameter space ruled out by current cosmological and microlensing observations can thus be directly mapped onto the ALP parameter space, thus providing new bounds on ALPs, complementary to the laboratory and astrophysical ALP constraints. Similarly, depending on the ALP couplings to other Standard Model particles, the ALP constraints on $f_a$ can be translated into a lower bound on the PBH mass scale. Moreover, the supercooled PT leads to a potentially observable stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal at future GW observatories, such as aLIGO, LISA and ET, that acts as another complementary probe of the ALPs, as well as of the PBH dark matter. Finally, we show that the recent NANOGrav signal of stochastic GW in the nHz frequency range can be explained in our model with $f_a\simeq (10~{\rm GeV}-1~{\rm TeV})$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

  We present Élivágar, a novel resource-efficient, noise-guided QCS framework. Élivágar innovates in all three major aspects of QCS -- search space, search algorithm and candidate evaluation strategy -- to address the design flaws in current classically-inspired QCS methods. Élivágar achieves hardware-efficiency and avoids an expensive circuit-mapping co-search via noise- and device topology-aware candidate generation. By introducing two cheap-to-compute predictors, Clifford noise resilience and Representational capacity, Élivágar decouples the evaluation of noise robustness and performance, enabling early rejection of low-fidelity circuits and reducing circuit evaluation costs. Due to its resource-efficiency, Élivágar can further search for data embeddings, significantly improving performance.

Detecting Dark Matter Substructures on Small Scales with Fast Radio Bursts,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08862v1,"Huangyu Xiao, Liang Dai, Matthew McQuinn","We propose measuring the arrival time difference of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) along two adjacent sightlines as a new probe to dark matter substructures on scales down to $\sim 1\,$AU. We discuss two observational scenarios in which it may be possible to place interesting constraints on such models through monitoring repeating FRB sources: 1) By sending radio receivers to space to form a baseline of tens of AU or more and measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between receivers. 2) By measuring the temporal variation of the arrival time difference between two lensed images of one strongly lensed repeater. In both scenarios, obtaining interesting constraints requires correlating the voltage time series to measure the radio-signal arrival time to sub-nanosecond precision. We find that two radio dishes separated by $20\,$AU may be sensitive to the enhancement of small-scale structures at $\sim 10^{-8}M_\odot$ masses in the QCD axion dark matter scenario or from an early epoch of matter-domination with a reheating temperature up to 60 MeV. Other dark matter models such as those composed of $\sim 10^{-13}M_{\odot}$ primordial black holes produced during inflation would also be probed by this method. We further show that a strong lensing situation of multiple images provides an equivalent $\sim 2000\,$AU baseline, which can be much more sensitive but with the uncertainty that intervening ISM decoherence may degrade the timing precision and that spatial variation in the FRB emission spot may result in confounding signals. We show that the lensing magnifications of Type Ia supernovea constrain a similar quantity to such FRB timing, with present limits being equivalent to ruling out the same parameter space that would be probed by a $0.14~$AU baseline.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

We show that RL quasars have redder continuum and enhanced [OII] emission than their RQ counterparts. These results persist when additionally matching in black hole mass, suggesting that this parameter is not the defining factor in making a QSO radio-loud.

Auriga adopts the $Λ$ Cold Dark Matter ($Λ$CDM) cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming main sequence, and HI gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that star-forming gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for $z\gtrsim 3$ before they ``settle'' into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios ($V/σ$). This evolution appears to be in rough agreement with some kinematic measurements from H$α$ observations, and demonstrates an application of how to utilise the released data.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Shadow of Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity and constraints from M87*,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.08693v1,"Qi Sun, Yu Zhang, Chen-Hao Xie, Qi-Quan Li","Motivated by the first image of a black hole captured by the EHT, there has been a surge of research using observations of black hole shadows to test gravity theories. In this paper, we carry out the related study about shadow of Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity, which deviates from the Kerr black hole due to the presence of the string parameter $a_0$ and the parameter $β$. The horizons, ergospheres, and photon region of the black hole are shown. Moreover, we explore the shadow and observations of the black hole, which are closely linked to the parameters $a_0$ and $β$. Treating M87* as Kerr black hole surrounded by a cloud of strings under Rastall gravity, we constrain the black hole parameters by the EHT observations. For a given $β$, the circularity deviation of the black hole obeys $ΔC\lesssim0.1$ in all regions. The angular diameter $θ_{d}=42\pm3μas$ can give the upper bound of parameters $a$ and $a_0$ for fixed $β$. The shadow axis ratio satisfies the observation data of EHT ($1<D_x\lesssim4/3$) in the whole space for a given $β$. These results are consistent with the public information of EHT. In other words, candidates for real astrophysical black holes can be Kerr black holes surrounded by a cloud of strings in Rastall gravity.",{'black holes': 2},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Initially, we determine the codimension-one generalized volume complexity by finding the extreme of the generally covariant volume functional. We show that its late-time growth rate aligns with the critical momenta linked to the extremal hypersurface. Consequently, we select the Gauss-Bonnet invariant as the scalar function in the definition of generalized volume complexity to examine the complexity's temporal variation. Interestingly, we note the possibility of numerous pseudo phase behaviors intricately tied to the configurations of the effective potentials related to the codimension-one hypersurface. Nevertheless, the complexity shows a linear growth in the ultimate phase in every scenario.

Through derived field equations, shape functions adhering to critical criteria governed by the Finsler parameter $γ$ are explored. By evaluating energy conditions, violations are found, which indicate the potential presence of exotic matter necessary for traversable wormholes.

Through a detailed analysis of Löwner inequalities between quantum and classical FIMs, this study uncovers the nuanced distinctions and implications of using each type of FIM. Our results indicate that a PQC-based agent using the quantum FIM without additional insights typically incurs a larger approximation error and does not guarantee improved performance compared to the classical FIM.

The phenylene ethynylene (PE) dendrimers display great potential in improving the efficiency of solar cells, because of their excellent photo-harvesting and exciton-transport properties. In this work, we investigated the intramolecular EET dynamics in a dendrimer composed of two linear PE units (2-ring and 3-ring) using the full quantum dynamics based on the tensor network method. We first constructed a diabatic model Hamiltonian based on the electronic structure calculations. Using this diabatic vibronic coupling model, we tried to obtain the main features of the EET dynamics in terms of the several diabatic models with different numbers of vibrational modes (from 4 modes to 129 modes) and to explore the corresponding vibronic coupling interactions. The results show that the EET in the current PE dendrimer is an ultrafast process. Four modes with A' symmetry play dominant roles in the dynamics, other 86 modes with A' symmetry can damp the electronic coherence, and the modes of A"" symmetry do not show the significant influence on the EET process. Overall, the first-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms show the dominant roles in the EET dynamics, while the second-order intrastate vibronic coupling terms give the visible impact here by damping the electronic coherence and slowing down the overall EET process. This work provides a valuable understanding of the physical insight in the EET dynamics of PE dendrimers.",{'tensor network': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Tensor Networks']

In order to express the derivative in terms of expectation values, we develop a circuit extraction procedure based on unitary dilation. We end by showing that the full gradient of a universal programmable interferometer can be estimated using polynomially many queries to a boson sampling device.

This provides an alternative set of equations, for which the integrability condition is obtained, to analyze the existence of gradient CKVs. A uniqueness result is obtained in the case of perfect fluids, where it is demonstrated that the Robertson-Walker solution is the unique perfect fluid solution with a nonvanishing pressure, admitting a timelike gradient CKV. The constant mean curvature condition for LRS spacetimes is also obtained, characterized by three distinct conditions which are specified by a set of three scalars. Linear combinations of these scalars, whose vanishing define the constant mean curvature condition, turn out to be related to the evolutions of null expansions of 2-sphere along their null normal directions. As such, some implications for the existence of black holes and the character of the associated horizons are obtained.

Thus, we ave a network of the PEE threads in the bulk with a density of the threads determined by the boundary PEE structure \cite{Lin:2023rbd}.We demonstrate that, for any static boundary region $A$, the homologous surface $Σ_{A}$ that has the minimal flux of the PEE threads passing through it is exactly the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) surface of $A$, and the minimal flux coincides with the holographic entanglement entropy of $A$.Furthermore, we show that the strength of the PEE flux at any bulk point along any direction is $1/4G$. Based on this observation, we prove that any area element in the bulk can be reconstructed by the PEE threads passing through it, which corresponds to a set of two-point PEEs on the CFT.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'holographic entanglement': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Randomly Pruning the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07325v1,Richard Berkovits,"The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK) is renowned for its short-time chaotic behavior, which plays a fundamental role in its application to various fields such as quantum gravity and holography. The Thouless energy, representing the energy scale at which the universal chaotic behavior in the energy spectrum ceases, can be determined from the spectrum itself. When simulating the SYK model on classical or quantum computers, it is advantageous to minimize the number of terms in the Hamiltonian by randomly pruning the couplings. In this paper, we demonstrate that even with a significant pruning, eliminating a large number of couplings, the chaotic behavior persists up to short time scales This is true even when only a fraction of the original $O(L^4)$ couplings in the fully connected SYK model, specifically $O(KL)$, is retained. Here, $L$ represents the number of sites, and $K\sim 10$.

Quantum chaos in PT symmetric quantum systems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.07215v1,"Kshitij Sharma, Himanshu Sahu, Subroto Mukerjee","In this study, we explore the interplay between $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and quantum chaos in a non-Hermitian dynamical system. We consider an extension of the standard diagnostics of quantum chaos, namely the complex level spacing ratio and out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), to study the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum kicked rotor model. The kicked rotor has long been regarded as a paradigmatic dynamic system to study classical and quantum chaos. By introducing non-Hermiticity in the quantum kicked rotor, we uncover new phases and transitions that are absent in the Hermitian system. From the study of the complex level spacing ratio, we locate three regimes -- one which is integrable and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, another which is chaotic with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry and a third which is chaotic but with broken $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry. We find that the complex level spacing ratio can distinguish between all three phases. Since calculations of the OTOC can be related to those of the classical Lyapunov exponent in the semi-classical limit, we investigate its nature in these regimes and at the phase boundaries. In the phases with $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry, the OTOC exhibits behaviour akin to what is observed in the Hermitian system in both the integrable and chaotic regimes. Moreover, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase, the OTOC demonstrates additional exponential growth stemming from the complex nature of the eigenvalue spectrum at later times. We derive the analytical form of the late-time behaviour of the OTOC. By defining a normalized OTOC to mitigate the effects caused by $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry breaking, we show that the OTOC exhibits singular behaviour at the transition from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric chaotic phase to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken, chaotic phase.",{'quantum chaos': 3},01.2024,2024,01,[]

Nonetheless, there is still a need to simulate large quantum systems classically, as the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are yet to be considered fault tolerant and performant enough in terms of operations per second. Each of the two main exact simulation techniques, state vector and tensor network simulators, boasts specific limitations. The exponential memory requirement of state vector simulation, when compared to the qubit register sizes of currently available quantum computers, quickly saturates the capacity of the top HPC machines currently available. Tensor network contraction approaches, which encode quantum circuits into tensor networks and then contract them over an output bit string to obtain its probability amplitude, still fall short of the inherent complexity of finding an optimal contraction path, which maps to a max-cut problem on a dense mesh, a notably NP-hard problem.

Augmenting computationally affordable low-rank approximations in CC theory with a perturbative account of higher-rank excitations is a tractable and effective way of accounting for the missing electron correlation in those approximations. This is perhaps best exemplified by the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) method, which bolsters the baseline CCSD with effects of triple excitations using considerations from many-body perturbation theory (MBPT). Despite this established success, such a synergy between MBPT and the unitary analog of CC theory (UCC) has not been explored.

The rationale behind these choices is shown to be rigorous by studying the properties of finite-order UCC energy functionals. Although our efforts do not support the addition of the fifth-order contribution as in the (T) correction, comparisons are nevertheless made using a hybrid UCCSD(T) approach.

Objects which have magnetic fields, spin, and accrete produce jets and collimated outflows. Jets are seen in systems ranging from brown dwarf stars to supermassive black holes. Outflow speeds are typically a few times the escape speed from the launch region - 100s of \kms\ for young stars to nearly the speed of light for black-holes. Because many young stellar objects (YSOs) are nearby, we can see outflow evolution and measure proper motions on times scales of years. Because the shocks in YSO outflows emit in atoms, ions, and molecules in addition to the continuum, many physical properties such as temperatures, densities, and velocities can be measured. Momenta and kinetic energies can be computed. YSO outflows are a major source of feedback in the self-regulation of star formation. The lessons learned can be applied to much more distant and energetic cosmic sources such as AGN and galactic nuclear super winds - systems in which evolution occurs on time-scales of hundreds to millions of years. Some dense star-forming regions produce powerful explosions. The nearest massive star-forming region, Orion OMC1, powered a $\sim 10^{48}$ erg explosion about 550 years ago (that is when the light from the event would have reached the Solar System). The OMC1 explosion was likely powered by an N-body interaction which resulted in the formation of a compact, AU-scale binary or resulted in a protostellar merger.

Achieving quantum advantages usually requires a large number of qubits and quantum circuits with enough capacity. However, limited coherence time and massive quantum noises severely constrain the size of quantum circuits that can be executed reliably on real machines. To address these two pain points, we propose QuantumSEA, an in-time sparse exploration for noise-adaptive quantum circuits, aiming to achieve two key objectives: (1) implicit circuits capacity during training - by dynamically exploring the circuit's sparse connectivity and sticking a fixed small number of quantum gates throughout the training which satisfies the coherence time and enjoy light noises, enabling feasible executions on real quantum devices; (2) noise robustness - by jointly optimizing the topology and parameters of quantum circuits under real device noise models. In each update step of sparsity, we leverage the moving average of historical gradients to grow necessary gates and utilize salience-based pruning to eliminate insignificant gates. Extensive experiments are conducted with 7 Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) benchmarks on 6 simulated or real quantum computers, where QuantumSEA consistently surpasses noise-aware search, human-designed, and randomly generated quantum circuit baselines by a clear performance margin.

We present a novel RG map, which operates on tensors with infinite-dimensional legs and does not involve truncations, in contrast to numerical tensor RG maps. To construct this map, we developed new techniques for analysing tensor networks. Our analysis shows that the constructed RG map contracts the region around the tensor $A_*$, corresponding to the high-temperature phase of the $3D$ Ising model. This leads to the iterated RG map convergence in the Hilbert-Schmidt norm to $A_*$ when initialised in the vicinity of $A_*$.

Efficient Quantum Trace Estimation with Reconfigurable Real-Time Circuits,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04176v1,"Yizhi Shen, Katherine Klymko, Eran Rabani, Daan Camps, Roel Van Beeumen, Michael Lindsey","Recently, quantum algorithms that leverage real-time evolution under a many-body Hamiltonian have proven to be exceptionally effective in estimating individual eigenvalues near the edge of the Hamiltonian spectrum, such as the ground state energy. By contrast, evaluating the trace of an operator requires the aggregation of eigenvalues across the entire spectrum. In this work, we introduce an efficient near-term quantum algorithm for computing the trace of a broad class of operators, including matrix functions of the target Hamiltonian. Our trace estimator is similar to the classical Girard-Hutchinson estimator in that it involves the preparation of many random states. Although the exact Girard-Hutchinson estimator is not tractably realizable on a quantum computer, we can construct random states that match the variance of the Girard-Hutchinson estimator through only real-time evolution. Importantly, our random states are all generated using the same Hamiltonians for real-time evolution, with randomness owing only to stochastic variations in the duration of the evolutions. In this sense, the circuit is reconfigurable and suitable for realization on both digital and analog platforms.

In this work, we focus on two fundamental tasks from the study of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problems: search-to-decision reductions, and approximate counting. We first show that, in strong contrast to the classical setting where a poly-time Turing machine requires $Θ(n)$ queries to an NP oracle to compute a witness to a given SAT formula, quantumly $Θ(\log n)$ queries suffice. We then show this is tight in the black-box model - any quantum algorithm with ""NP-like"" query access to a formula requires $Ω(\log n)$ queries to extract a solution with constant probability. Moving to approximate counting of SAT solutions, by exploiting a quantum link between search-to-decision reductions and approximate counting, we show that existing classical approximate counting algorithms are likely optimal. First, we give a lower bound in the ""NP-like"" black-box query setting: Approximate counting requires $Ω(\log n)$ queries, even on a quantum computer. We then give a ""white-box"" lower bound (i.e. where the input formula is not hidden in the oracle) - if there exists a randomized poly-time classical or quantum algorithm for approximate counting making $o(log n)$ NP queries, then $\text{BPP}^{\text{NP}[o(n)]}$ contains a $\text{P}^{\text{NP}}$-complete problem if the algorithm is classical and $\text{FBQP}^{\text{NP}[o(n)]}$ contains an $\text{FP}^{\text{NP}}$-complete problem if the algorithm is quantum.",{'quantum computer': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Quantum computing provides a promising route for overcoming these difficulties to find ground states, dynamics, and more. In this paper, we argue that recently developed hybrid quantum-classical algorithms based on real-time evolution are promising methods for solving a particularly important model in the search for spin liquids, the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the two-dimensional kagome lattice. We show how to construct efficient quantum circuits to implement time evolution for the model and to evaluate key observables on the quantum computer, and we argue that the method has favorable scaling with increasing system size. We then restrict to a 12-spin star plaquette from the kagome lattice and a related 8-spin system, and we give an empirical demonstration on these small systems that the hybrid algorithms can efficiently find the ground state energy and the magnetization curve. For these demonstrations, we use four levels of approximation: exact state vectors, exact state vectors with statistical noise from sampling, noisy classical emulators, and (for the 8-spin system only) real quantum hardware, specifically the Quantinuum H1-1 processor; for the noisy simulations, we also employ error mitigation strategies based on the symmetries of the Hamiltonian.

Accurately determining this number and distribution of BH masses can provide crucial information about the processes involved in BH formation, the possibility of the existence of primordial BHs, and interpreting gravitational wave (GW) signals detected in LIGO-VIRGO-KAGRA. Sahu et al. recently confirmed one isolated stellar-mass BH in our galaxy using astrometric microlensing. This work proposes a novel method to identify such BHs using the gravitational analog of the Gertsenshtein-Zel'dovich (GZ) effect. We explicitly demonstrate the generation of GWs when a kilohertz(kHz) electromagnetic (EM) pulse from a pulsar is intervened by a spherically symmetric compact object situated between the pulsar and Earth. Specifically, we show that the curvature of spacetime acts as the catalyst, akin to the magnetic field in the GZ effect. Using the covariant semi-tetrad formalism, we quantify the GW generated from the EM pulse through the Regge-Wheeler tensor and express the amplitude of the generated GW in terms of the EM energy and flux. We demonstrate how GW detectors can detect stellar-mass BHs by considering known pulsars within our galaxy. This approach has a distinct advantage in detecting stellar mass BHs at larger distances since the GW amplitude falls as $1/r$.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Expanding this unique method of study to cosmic structures and combining past knowledge with new data can be very interesting and lead to discovering new ways to analyze these systems. However, studying black hole symmetries always presents many complications and sometimes requires computational approximations. For example, checking the existence of Killing vectors and then calculating them is not always an easy task. It becomes much more difficult as the structure and geometry of the system become more complex. In this work, we will show that if the wave equations with a black hole background can be converted in the form of general Heun equation, based on its structure and coefficients, the algebra of the system can be easily studied, and computational and geometrical complications can be omitted. For this purpose, we selected two $AdS_5$ black holes: Reissner-Nordstrom (R-N) and Kerr, and analyzed the Klein-Gordon equation with the background of these black holes. Based on this concept, we observed that the radial part of the R-N black hole and both the radial and angular parts of the Kerr black hole could be transformed into the general form of the Heun equation.

The virial factor had been believed to be independent of accretion radiation pressure on gas clouds in broad-line region (BLR), and only dependent on inclination effects of BLR. The virial factor measured spans a very large range. For the vast majority of AGNs ($>$96%) in our samples, the virial factor is larger than $f=1$ usually used in literatures. The $f$ correction makes the percent of high-accreting AGNs decrease by about 100 times. There are positive correlations of $f$ with the dimensionless accretion rate and Eddington ratio. The redward shifts of H$β$ and H$α$ are mainly the gravitational origin, confirmed by a negative correlation between the redward shift and the dimensionless radius of BLR. Our results show that radiation pressure force is a significant contributor to the measured virial factor, containing the inclination effects of BLR. The usually used values of $f$ should be corrected for high-accreting AGNs, especially high redshift quasars. The $f$ correction increases their masses by one--two orders of magnitude, which will make it more challenging to explain the formation and growth of supermassive black holes at high redshifts.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Link-area commutators in AdS${}_3$ area-networks,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02487v1,"Jesse Held, Molly Kaplan, Donald Marolf, Jie-qiang Wu","Random tensor networks (RTNs) have proved to be fruitful tools for modelling the AdS/CFT correspondence. Due to their flat entanglement spectra, when discussing a given boundary region $R$ and its complement $\bar R$, standard RTNs are most analogous to fixed-area states of the bulk quantum gravity theory, in which quantum fluctuations have been suppressed for the area of the corresponding HRT surface. However, such RTNs have flat entanglement spectra for all choices of $R, \bar R,$ while quantum fluctuations of multiple HRT-areas can be suppressed only when the corresponding HRT-area operators mutually commute. We probe the severity of such obstructions in pure AdS$_3$ Einstein-Hilbert gravity by constructing networks whose links are codimension-2 extremal-surfaces and by explicitly computing semiclassical commutators of the associated link-areas. Since $d=3,$ codimension-2 extremal-surfaces are geodesics, and codimension-2 `areas' are lengths. We find a simple 4-link network defined by an HRT surface and a Chen-Dong-Lewkowycz-Qi constrained HRT surface for which all link-areas commute. However, the algebra generated by the link-areas of more general networks tends to be non-Abelian. One such non-Abelian example is associated with entanglement-wedge cross sections and may be of more general interest.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'geodesics': 1, 'tensor networks': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,"['Tensor Networks', 'Holography', 'Black Holes and GR']"

The fates of those early, metal-poor, massive stars are highly uncertain. Most are expected to directly collapse to black holes, while some may explode as a result of rotationally powered engines or the pair-creation instability. We present the chemical abundances of J0931+0038, a nearby low-mass star identified in early followup of SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, which preserves the signature of unusual nucleosynthesis from a massive star in the early universe. J0931+0038 has relatively high metallicity ([Fe/H] = -1.76 +/- 0.13) but an extreme odd-even abundance pattern, with some of the lowest known abundance ratios of [N/Fe], [Na/Fe], [K/Fe], [Sc/Fe], and [Ba/Fe]. The implication is that a majority of its metals originated in a single extremely metal-poor nucleosynthetic source. An extensive search through nucleosynthesis predictions finds a clear preference for progenitors with initial mass > 50 Msun, making J0931+0038 one of the first observational constraints on nucleosynthesis in this mass range. However the full abundance pattern is not matched by any models in the literature. J0931+0038 thus presents a challenge for the next generation of nucleosynthesis models and motivates study of high-mass progenitor stars impacted by convection, rotation, jets, and/or binary companions.

Indeed, for low $a_0$ values, we find that the halo total mass $M$ decreases the potential values significantly while for high $a_0$ values such impact is diluted. Regarding the shadow aspects, we show that the shadow size is much smaller for high values of $a_0$ while the opposite effect is observed when the halo total mass $M$ is increased. By comparing our case to the slowly rotating case, we notice that the former exhibits a shadow shifted from its center to the left side.

Using a luminous galaxy catalog and a spherical void finding algorithm, we identify 5,078 voids at redshift $z = 0$. Within the voids, mass does not directly trace light. Instead, the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the locations of void galaxies is systematically lower than the mean radial underdensity profile as defined by the dark matter (i.e., the voids are more ``devoid'' of galaxies than they are of mass). Within the voids, the integrated underdensity profiles of the dark matter and the galaxies are independent of the local background density (i.e., voids-in-voids vs.\ voids-in-clouds). Beyond the void radii, however, the integrated underdensity profiles of both the dark matter and the galaxies exhibit strong dependencies on the local background density. Compared to non-void galaxies, void galaxies are on average younger, less massive, bluer in color, less metal enriched, and have smaller radii.

The unusual property of this algorithm is that in the presence of a depolarizing channel it still displays a meaningful, non-zero signal in the large depth limit. We showcase the noise resilience of this quantum channel on Quantinuum's H1-1 ion-trap quantum computer.","{'quantum circuit': 1, 'quantum computer': 1}",01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Superselection-Resolved Entanglement in Lattice Gauge Theories: A Tensor Network Approach,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01942v1,"Noa Feldman, Johannes Knaute, Erez Zohar, Moshe Goldstein","Lattice gauge theories (LGT) play a central role in modern physics, providing insights into high-energy physics, condensed matter physics, and quantum computation. Due to the nontrivial structure of the Hilbert space of LGT systems, entanglement in such systems is tricky to define. However, when one limits themselves to superselection-resolved entanglement, that is, entanglement corresponding to specific gauge symmetry sectors (commonly denoted as superselection sectors), this problem disappears, and the entanglement becomes well-defined. The study of superselection-resolved entanglement is interesting in LGT for an additional reason: when the gauge symmetry is strictly obeyed, superselection-resolved entanglement becomes the only distillable contribution to the entanglement. In our work, we study the behavior of superselection-resolved entanglement in LGT systems. We employ a tensor network construction for gauge-invariant systems as defined by Zohar and Burrello (2016) and find that, in a vast range of cases, the leading term in superselection-resolved entanglement depends on the number of corners in the partition, that is, corner-law entanglement. To our knowledge, this is the first case of such a corner-law being observed in any lattice system.",{'tensor network': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Tensor Networks']

NIRDust: Probing Hot Dust Emission Around Type 2 AGN Using K-band Spectra,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01888v1,"Gaia Gaspar, Martín Chalela, Juan Cabral, José Alacoria, Damián Mast, Rubén J. Díaz","Hot dust in the proximity of AGNs strongly emits in the Near Infrared producing a red excess that, in type 2 sources, can be modeled to measure its temperature. In the era of high spatial-resolution multi-wavelength data, mapping the hot dust around Supermassive Black Holes is important for the efforts to achieve a complete picture of the dust role and distribution around these compact objects.
  In this work we propose a methodology to detect the hot dust emission in the proximity of Type 2 AGNs and measure its temperature using K-band spectra ($λ_c$ = 2.2\,$μ$m).
  To achieve this, we have developed NIRDust, a Python package for modeling K-band spectra, estimate the dust temperature and characterize the involved uncertainties. We tested synthetic and real spectra in order to check the performance and suitability of the physical model over different types of data.
  Our tests on synthetic spectra demonstrated that the obtained results are influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the input spectra. However, we accurately characterized the uncertainties, which remained below $\sim$150 K for an average S/N per pixel exceeding 20. Applying NIRDust to NGC 5128 (Centaurus A), observed with the Gemini South Telescope, we estimated a dust temperature of 662 and 667 K from Flamingos-2 spectra and 697 and 607 K from GNIRS spectra using two different approaches.",{'black holes': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Observations on the massive particle surface method,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01821v1,"Ednaldo L. B. Junior, José Tarciso S. S. Junior, Francisco S. N. Lobo, Manuel E. Rodrigues, Luís F. Dias da Silva, Henrique A. Vieira","The geodesic method has played a crucial role in understanding the circular orbits generated by compact objects, culminating in the definition of the photon sphere, which was later generalized to a photon surface in arbitrary spacetimes. This new formulation extends the concept of the photon sphere in a broader sense, including dynamical spacetimes, as shown by the Vaidya solution. The photon surface essentially defines the null geodesics, which are originally tangent to the temporal surface, and keeps them confined to this surface. However, this formalism does not cover all classes of particles, and to overcome this limitation, a more comprehensive approach, denoted as the ""massive particle surface"", has been proposed that also accounts for charged massive particles. Indeed, the photon surface concept is recovered when the charge and mass of the particles are zero. In this work, we use these three formalisms to check the consistency of the results for the values of the radius of the photon sphere ($r_{ps}$) and the radius of the ""innermost stable circular orbit"" (ISCO) ($r_{\rm ISCO}$) for some gravitational models. In our results, the first model is described by conformal gravity, with the peculiarity that $g_{00}\neq-g_{11}^{-1}$. The second model, i.e. the Culetu solution, is developed by coupling General Relativity with nonlinear electrodynamics, which requires the consideration of the effective metric ($g_{\rm eff}^{μν}$) for geodesic approaches. Furthermore, we have also analysed the expressions for $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\rm ISCO}$ in a general static and spherically symmetric metric. Under these circumstances, we have found a discrepancy of $r_{ps}$ and $r_{\rm ISCO}$ obtained by the massive particle surface formalism as compared to the geodesic and photon surface formalisms.",{'geodesics': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Absorption and (unbounded) superradiance in a static regular black hole spacetime,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01767v1,"Marco A. A. de Paula, Luiz C. S. Leite, Sam R. Dolan, Luís C. B.

Here we study the absorption, and superradiant amplification, of a monochromatic planar wave in a charged, massive scalar field impinging on the electrically-charged Ayón-Beato-García (ABG) RBH. Comparisons are drawn with absorption and superradiance for the Reissner-Nordström (RN) black hole in linear electrodynamics. We find that, in a certain parameter regime, the ABG absorption cross section is negative, due to superradiance, and moreover it is unbounded from below as the momentum of the wave approaches zero; this phenomenon of ``unbounded superradiance'' is absent in the RN case. We show how the parameter space can be divided into regions, using the bounded/unbounded and absorption/amplification boundaries. After introducing a high-frequency approximation based on particle trajectories, we calculate the absorption cross section numerically, via the partial-wave expansion, as function of wave frequency, and we present a gallery of results. The cross section of the ABG RBH is found to be larger (smaller) than in the RN case when the field charge has the same (opposite) sign as the black hole charge. We show that it is possible to find ``mimics'': situations in which the cross sections of both black holes are very similar.

Such mergers are predicted to originate in the vicinity of massive black holes (MBHs). Especially, GW190814, due to its secondary mass and mass ratio being beyond the expectations of isolated stellar evolution theories, is a promising event that has happened in an active galactic nucleus(AGN) disk. In this model, a compact object resides in the vicinity of a merging BBH. Here we report multiple pieces of evidence pointing to the fact that GW190814 is a BBH merging near a compact object. The orbital motion of BBHs around the third body produces a line-of-sight acceleration (LSA) and induces a varying Doppler shift. Using a waveform template that considers LSA, we perform Bayesian inference on a few BBH events with a high signal-to-noise ratio in the gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC). Compared to the model for isolated BBH mergers, we obtain significantly higher network signal-to-noise ratios for GW190814 by that with the LSA and constrain the LSA to $a = 0.0014^{+0.0014}_{-0.0022} ~c~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. In addition, the logarithmic Bayes factor for the LSA case over the isolated case is $16.6$, which means the LSA model is significantly preferred by the GW data.

In this paper, we consider a more general setup and treatment of islands in a $d-$dimensional AdS black hole background. The quantum fields modeling the Hawking radiation have a scale and are consistently inherited from a conformal parent theory; their symmetries are thus compatible with those of curved backgrounds. We demonstrate explicitly that the existence of islands is sensitive to the choice of CFT used to model the Hawking radiation. We compute the renormalised entanglement entropy of conformal fields on a negatively curved background in $d$ dimensions at zero temperature as well as the thermal regulated entropy of an entangling region near the UV boundary. Using the latter quantity as the entropy of the Hawking radiation, we find that islands never emerge for $d>2$.",{'hawking radiation': 3},01.2024,2024,01,['Black Holes and GR']

Restart uncertainty relation for monitored quantum dynamics,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01307v1,"Ruoyu Yin, Qingyuan Wang, Sabine Tornow, Eli Barkai","We introduce a novel time-energy uncertainty relationship within the context of restarts in monitored quantum dynamics. Initially, we investigate the concept of ``first hitting time'' in quantum systems using an IBM quantum computer and a three-site ring graph as our starting point. Previous studies have established that the mean recurrence time, which represents the time taken to return to the initial state, is quantized as an integer multiple of the sampling time, displaying pointwise discontinuous transitions at resonances. Our findings demonstrate that, the natural utilization of the restart mechanism in laboratory experiments, driven by finite data collection time spans, leads to a broadening effect on the transitions of the mean recurrence time. Our newly proposed uncertainty relation captures the underlying essence of these phenomena, by connecting the broadening of the mean hitting time near resonances, to the intrinsic energies of the quantum system and to the fluctuations of recurrence time. This work not only contributes to our understanding of fundamental aspects related to quantum measurements and dynamics, but also offers practical insights for the design of efficient quantum algorithms with mid-circuit measurements.",{'quantum computer': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
"To Wedge Or Not To Wedge, Wedges and operator reconstructability in toy models of AdS/CFT",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01287v1,Vic Vander Linden,"The AdS/CFT correspondence is an explicit realization of the holographic principle relating a theory of gravity in a volume of space to a lower dimensional quantum field theory on its boundary. By exploiting elements of quantum error correction, qubit toy models of this correspondence have been constructed for which the bulk logical operators are representable by operators acting on the boundary. Given a boundary subregion, wedges in the volume space are used to enclose the bulk qubits for which logical operators are reconstructable on that boundary subregion. In this thesis a number of different wedges, such as the causal wedge, greedy entanglement wedge and minimum entanglement wedge, are examined. More specifically, Monte-Carlo simulations of boundary erasure are performed with various toy models to study the differences between wedges and the effect on these wedge by the type of the model, non-uniform boundaries and stacking of models. It has been found that the minimum entanglement wedge is the best approximate for the true geometric wedge. This is illustrated by an example toy model for which an operator beyond the greedy entanglement wedge was also reconstructed. In addition, by calculating the entropy of these subregions, the viability of a mutual information wedge is rejected. Only for particular connected boundary subregions was the inclusion of the central tensor by the geometric wedge associated to a rise in mutual information.",{'AdS/CFT': 1},01.2024,2024,01,['Holography']

Magnetic monopoles and primordial black holes (PBHs), two unsolved mysteries in the universe, may also have their production related to the cosmological phase transition. Inspired by that, we revisit the model proposed by Stojkovic and Freese, which involves PBHs accretion to solve the cosmological magnetic monopole problem. We further develop it by considering the increase in the mass of the PBHs during accretion and taking the effect of Hawking radiation into account. With these new considerations, we find that solutions to the problem still exist within a certain parameter space. In {addition}, we also generalize the analysis to PBHs with {an} extended distribution in mass.

To mitigate these challenges, an approach using distributed quantum neural networks has been proposed to make a prediction by approximating outputs of a large circuit using multiple small circuits. However, the approximation of a large circuit requires an exponential number of small circuit evaluations. Here, we instead propose to distribute partitioned features over multiple small quantum neural networks and use the ensemble of their expectation values to generate predictions. To verify our distributed approach, we demonstrate ten class classification of the Semeion and MNIST handwritten digit datasets. The results of the Semeion dataset imply that while our distributed approach may outperform a single quantum neural network in classification performance, excessive partitioning reduces performance. Nevertheless, for the MNIST dataset, we succeeded in ten class classification with exceeding 96\% accuracy. Our proposed method not only achieved highly accurate predictions for a large dataset but also reduced the hardware requirements for each quantum neural network compared to a large single quantum neural network.

Entanglement of edge modes in (very) strongly correlated topological insulators,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.13598v2,"Nisa Ara, Rudranil Basu, Emil Mathew, Indrakshi Raychowdhury","Identifying topological phases for a strongly correlated theory remains a non-trivial task, as defining order parameters, such as Berry phases, is not straightforward. Quantum information theory is capable of identifying topological phases for a theory that exhibits quantum phase transition with a suitable definition of order parameters that are related to different entanglement measures for the system. In this work, we study entanglement entropy for a bi-layer SSH model, both in the presence and absence of Hubbard interaction and at varying interaction strengths. For the free theory, edge entanglement acts as an order parameter, which is supported by analytic calculations and numerical (DMRG) studies. We calculate the symmetry-resolved entanglement and demonstrate the equipartition of entanglement for this model which itself acts as an order parameter when calculated for the edge modes. As the DMRG calculation allows one to go beyond the free theory, we study the entanglement structure of the edge modes in the presence of on-site Hubbard interaction for the same model. A sudden reduction of edge entanglement is obtained as interaction is switched on. The explanation for this lies in the change in the size of the degenerate subspaces in the presence and absence of interaction. We also study the signature of entanglement when the interaction strength becomes extremely strong and demonstrate that the edge entanglement remains protected. In this limit, the energy eigenstates essentially become a tensor product state, implying zero entanglement. However, a remnant entropy survives in the non-trivial topological phase which is exactly due to the entanglement of the edge modes.",{'quantum information theory': 1},12.2023,2023,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

For a set of small molecular systems we calculated the exact Trotter approximation errors of the first order Trotter formulas for the ground state electronic energies. Comparison of these errors with previously used upper bounds show almost no correlation over the systems and various Hamiltonian partitionings. On the other hand, building the Trotter approximation error estimation based on perturbation theory up to a second order in the time-step for eigenvalues provides estimates with very good correlations with the Trotter approximation errors.

Holography in Flat Spacetimes: the case for Carroll,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.11246v2,"Arjun Bagchi, Prateksh Dhivakar, Sudipta Dutta","We compare and contrast the two approaches of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes, viz. the co-dimension two Celestial approach based on the Mellin transformation and the co-dimension one Carrollian approach based on the modified Mellin and elucidate how some of the problems of the Celestial approach can be rectified by the Carrollian one. Considering flat holography as a limit from AdS/CFT makes a co-dimension one dual more plausible, and our previous construction of Carrollian correlations from AdS Witten diagrams is testimony to this. In this paper, we show how to generalize our earlier analysis for operators with spin. We work out a large number of explicit non-trivial examples (twelve) and show matching between the limit of AdS$_4$ Witten diagrams and 3d boundary symmetry considerations, thus making the case for the Carrollian dual even stronger.","{'AdS/CFT': 1, 'holography': 2}",11.2023,2023,11,['Holography']
Delayed X-ray brightening accompanied by variable ionized absorption following a tidal disruption event,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09371v2,"T. Wevers, M. Guolo, D. R. Pasham, E. R. Coughlin, F. Tombesi, Y. Yao, S. Gezari","Supermassive black holes can experience super-Eddington peak mass fallback rates following the tidal disruption of a star. The theoretical expectation is that part of the infalling material is expelled by means of an accretion disk wind, whose observational signature includes blueshifted absorption lines of highly ionized species in X-ray spectra. To date, however, only one such ultra-fast outflow (UFO) has been reported in the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. Here we report on the discovery of transient absorption-like signatures in X-ray spectra of the TDE AT2020ksf/Gaia20cjk (at a redshift of $z$=0.092), following an X-ray brightening $\sim 230$ days after UV/optical peak. We find that while no statistically significant absorption features are present initially, they appear on a timescale of several days, and remain detected up to 770 days after peak. Simple thermal continuum models, combined with a power-law or neutral absorber, do not describe these features well. Adding a partial covering, low velocity ionized absorber improves the fit at early times, but fails at late times. A high velocity (v$_w$ $\sim$ 42000 km s$^{-1}$, or -0.15c), ionized absorber (ultra-fast outflow) provides a good fit to all data. The few day timescale of variability is consistent with expectations for a clumpy wind. We discuss several scenarios that could explain the X-ray delay, as well as the potential for larger scale wind feedback. The serendipitous nature of the discovery could suggest a high incidence of UFOs in TDEs, alleviating some of the tension with theoretical expectations.",{'black holes': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']
Determining cosmological growth parameter for stellar-mass black holes,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09007v2,"Ema Mlinar, Tomaž Zwitter","It has recently been suggested that black holes (BHs) may grow with time, so that their mass is proportional to the cosmological scale factor to the power $n$, with suggested values $n \approx 3$ for supermassive BHs in elliptical galaxies. Here we test these predictions with stellar mass BHs in X-ray binaries using their masses and ages. We perform two sets of tests to assess the compatible values of $n$. First, we assume that no compact object grows over the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkof limit which marks the borderline between neutron stars and BHs. We show that half of BHs would be born with a mass below this limit if $n=3$ applies. The possibility that all BHs were born above the limit is rejected at $4\,σ$ if $n=3$ applies. In the second test, we assume that masses of BHs at their formation stay the same over cosmic history. We compare the mass distribution of the youngest BHs, which could have not grown yet, to their older counterparts. Distributions are compatible for $n = -0.9^{+1.3}_{-4.6}$, with $n=3$ excluded formally with 87 % confidence. This result may be biased, because massive BHs tend to have a massive companion. Correcting for this bias yields $n\approx 0$. We can therefore conclude that while our results are not a clear rejection of BH scaling with $n=3$, we show that $n=0$ is much more consistent with the data.",{'black holes': 1},11.2023,2023,11,['Black Holes and GR']

Then we proceed to formulate the corresponding quantum algorithm, including the quantum circuit layout and analyze its computational viability. We show that, at least for moderate Reynolds numbers between 10 and 100, the Carleman-LB procedure can be successfully truncated at second order, which is a very encouraging result. We also show that the quantum circuit implementing the single time-step collision operator has a fixed depth, regardless of the number of lattice sites. However, such depth is of the order of ten thousands quantum gates, meaning that quantum advantage over classical computing is not attainable today, but could be achieved in the near-mid term future.

Constraints on charged black holes from merger-ringdown signals in GWTC-3 and prospects for the Einstein Telescope,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10447v2,"Hua-Peng Gu, Hai-Tian Wang, Lijing Shao","Whether astrophysical black holes (BHs) can have charge is a question to be addressed by observations. In the era of gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, one can constrain the charge of a merged BH remnant using the merger-ringdown signal of the GW data. Extending earlier studies, we analyze five GW events in GWTC-3, assuming Kerr-Newman BHs. Our results show no strong evidence for a charged BH, and give a limit on the charge-to-mass-ratio $Q<0.37$ at $90\%$ credible level (CL). Due to the charge-spin degeneracy in the waveform and the limited signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), it is challenging for LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations to provide better constraints. We further simulate data for the Einstein Telescope (ET), where SNRs can be as large as $\sim270$ in the ringdown signal. These simulated events allow us to consider the 220, 221, and 330 ringdown modes altogether, which can help break the charge-spin degeneracy.

Grassmann Time-Evolving Matrix Product Operators for Equilibrium Quantum Impurity Problems,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.09842v2,"Ruofan Chen, Xiansong Xu, Chu Guo","Tensor-network-based methods are promising candidates to solve quantum impurity problems. They are free of sampling noises and the sign problem compared to state-of-the-art continuous-time quantum Monte Carlo methods. Recent progress made in tensor-network-based impurity solvers is to use the Feynman-Vernon influence functional to integrate out the bath analytically, retaining only the impurity dynamics and representing it compactly as a matrix product state. The recently proposed Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator (GTEMPO) method is one of the representative methods in this direction. In this work, we systematically study the performance of GTEMPO in solving equilibrium quantum impurity problems at a finite temperature with a semicircular spectrum density of the bath. Our results show that its computational cost would generally increase as the temperature goes down and scale exponentially with the number of orbitals. In particular, the single-orbital Anderson impurity model can be efficiently solved with this method, for two orbitals we estimate that one could possibly reach inverse temperature $β\approx 20$ if high-performance computing techniques are utilized, while beyond that only very high-temperature regimes can be reached in the current formalism.

A fast test for the identification and confirmation of massive black hole binaries,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.06896v2,"Massimo Dotti, Fabio Rigamonti, Stefano Rinaldi, Walter Del Pozzo, Roberto Decarli, Riccardo Buscicchio","We present a new observational test to identify massive black hole binaries in large multi-epoch spectroscopical catalogues and to probe the real nature of already proposed binary candidates. The test is tailored for binaries with separations large enough to allow each black hole to retain its own broad line region. In this limit the fast AGN variability typically observed over months cannot be associated to the much longer binary period, and it is assumed (as for the case of single black holes) to be the consequence of the evolution of the innermost regions of the two accretion discs. A simple analysis of the cross-correlation between different parts of individual broad emission lines can therefore identify the presence of two massive black holes whose continua vary independently of each other. Our analysis indicates that to be less affected by the noise in the spectra the broad lines should be divided in two close-to-equal-flux parts. This ensures that in the single massive black hole scenario the cross-correlation will always be high. With monitoring campaigns similar to those performed for reverberation mapping studies, on the other way, a binary can show any value of the cross-correlation and can therefore be distinguished from a standard AGN. The new test can be performed over timescales orders of magnitude shorter than the alternative tests already discussed in literature, and can be a powerful complement to the massive black hole binary search strategies already in place.",{'black holes': 2},10.2023,2023,10,['Black Holes and GR']
Emergence of Species Scale Black Hole Horizons,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04488v3,"José Calderón-Infante, Matilda Delgado, Angel M.

We use black holes of vanishing horizon area (small black holes) in effective field theories coupled to quantum gravity to shed light on how the three different physical manifestations of the species scale $Λ_s$ relate to each other. (i) Near the small black hole core, a scalar field runs to infinite distance in moduli space, a regime in which the Swampland Distance Conjecture predicts a tower of exponentially light states, which lower $Λ_s$. (ii) We integrate out modes in the tower and generate via Emergence a set of higher derivative corrections, showing that $Λ_s$ is the scale at which such terms become relevant. (iii) Finally, higher derivative terms modify the black hole solution and grant it a non-zero, species scale sized stretched horizon of radius $Λ_s^{-1}$, showcasing the species scale as the size of the smallest possible black hole describable in the effective theory. We present explicit 4d examples of small black holes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity, and the 10d example of type IIA D0-branes.

Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15897v3,"Jonah Kudler-Flam, Samuel Leutheusser, Gautam Satishchandran","It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of ""semi-classical"" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor ""localized"" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another ""boundary structure"" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.",{'black holes': 3},09.2023,2023,09,['Black Holes and GR']

Steiner, Javier A. Garcia","The development of techniques to measure accurately black hole spins is crucial to study the physics and astrophysics of these objects. X-ray reflection spectroscopy is currently the most popular method to estimate the spins of accreting black holes; so far it has provided a spin measurement of about 40 stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries and 40 supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. The relativistic precession model (RPM) is another method to measure the spins of stellar-mass black holes: it requires the measurement of the frequencies of three simultaneous quasi-periodic oscillations and can potentially provide precise estimates of the black hole mass and spin. However, the two methods do not seem to provide consistent results when applied to the same sources, which questions the reliability and accuracy of these measurements. Recently, the RPM has been applied to infer the spin of the black hole in XTE J1859+226. The authors found $a_* = 0.149 \pm 0.005$ (68% CL). There are no other spin measurements of this source. We looked for archived RXTE observations of XTE J1859+226 with blurred reflection features and found 23 spectra suitable for measuring the spin.

While previous searches targeted sources that are representative of observed neutron star binaries in the galaxy, it is already known that neutron stars can regularly be spun up to a dimensionless spin of $\sim0.4$, and in principle reach up to $\sim0.7$ before breakup would occur. Furthermore, there may be primordial black hole binaries or exotic formation mechanisms to produce light black holes. In these cases, it is possible for the binary constituent to be spun up beyond that achievable by a neutron star. A single detection of this type of source would reveal a novel formation channel for compact-binaries. To determine if there is evidence for any such sources, we use PyCBC to conduct a targeted search of LIGO and Virgo data for light compact objects with high spin.

In doing so, we numerically solve the governing equations that describe the flow motion around the compact objects in a general relativistic framework, where spin ($a_{k}$) and deformation parameters ($\varepsilon$) demonstrate the nature of the central source, namely black hole (BH) or naked singularity (NS). With this, we obtain all possible classes of global accretion solutions ($i. e.$, O, A, W and I-type) by varying the energy ($E$) and angular momentum ($λ$) of the relativistic accretion flow, and examine the role of thermal bremsstrahlung emission in studying the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the accretion disc. We divide the parameter space in $λ-E$ plane in terms of the different classes of accretion solutions for BH and NS models. We further calculate the disc luminosity ($L$) corresponding to these accretion solutions, and observe that I-type solutions yield higher $L$ and SEDs than the remaining types of solutions for both BH and NS models. For BH model, SEDs for W and I-type solutions differ significantly from the results for O and A-type solutions for low $E$ values. On the contrary, for NS model, SEDs for different accretion solutions are identical in the whole parameter space of $λ$ and $E$. We also examine the effect of $\varepsilon$ on the SEDs and observe that a non-Kerr BH yields higher SEDs than the usual Kerr BH.

Evolution of eccentric stellar disks around supermassive black holes: the complex disk disruption dynamics and the milliparsec stars,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12344v2,"Antti Rantala, Thorsten Naab","We study the 10 Myr evolution of parsec-scale stellar disks with initial masses of $M_{\mathrm{disk}} = 1.0$ - $7.5 \times 10^4 M_\odot$ and eccentricities $e_\mathrm{init}=0.1$-$0.9$ around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). Our disk models are embedded in a spherical background potential and have top-heavy single and binary star initial mass functions (IMF) with slopes of $0.25$-$1.7$. The systems are evolved with the N-body code $\texttt{BIFROST}$ including post-Newtonian (PN) equations of motion and simplified stellar evolution. All disks are unstable and evolve on Myr timescales towards similar eccentricity distributions peaking at $e_\star \sim 0.3$-$0.4$. Models with high $e_\mathrm{init}$ also develop a very eccentric $(e_\star\gtrsim0.9)$ stellar population. For higher disk masses $M_\mathrm{disk} \gtrsim3 \times10^4\;\mathrm{M_\odot}$, the disk disruption dynamics is more complex than the standard secular eccentric disk instability with opposite precession directions at different disk radii - a precession direction instability. We present an analytical model describing this behavior. A milliparsec population of $N\sim10$-$100$ stars forms around the SMBH in all models. For low $e_\mathrm{init}$ stars migrate inward while for $e_\mathrm{init}\gtrsim0.6$ stars are captured by the Hills mechanism.

The population of massive stars and black holes in AGN disks captured from the nuclei cluster plays a crucial role in determining the efficiency of binary formation and final merger rate within the AGN disks. In this paper, we investigate the capture process using analytical and numerical approaches. We discover a new constant integral of motion for one object's capture process. Applying this result to the whole population of the nuclei cluster captured by the AGN disk, we find that the population of captured objects depends on the angular density and eccentricity distribution of the nuclei clusters and is effectively independent of the radial density profile of the nuclei cluster and disk models. An isotropic nuclei cluster with thermal eccentricity distribution predicts a captured profile $d N/d r \propto r^{-1/4}$. The captured objects are found to be dynamically crowded within the disk.

We develop Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators, a full fermionic analog of TEMPO, that can directly manipulates Grassmann path integrals with similar numerical cost as the bosonic counterpart. We further propose a zipup algorithm to compute expectation values on the fly without explicitly building a single large augmented density tensor, which boosts our efficiency on top of the vanilla TEMPO. Our method has a favorable complexity scaling over existing tensor network methods, and we demonstrate its performance on the non-equilibrium dynamics of the single impurity Anderson models.

A review on the questions of spin and spin quantum correlations in the relativistic regime,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.05231v2,Shrobona Bagchi,"The majority of current understanding of the quantum correlations is in the field of non-relativistic quantum mechanics. To develop quantum information and computation tasks fully, one must inevitably take into account the relativistic effects. In this regard, the spin is one of the central tools. For this purpose, it is of paramount importance to understand and characterize fully the theory of spin in relativistic quantum information theory where the spin states act as qubit. This area is still far from being resolved. As a result, this article will explore the recent studies of the concepts of the spin and spin quantum correlations in inertial frames and some apparent paradoxes regarding this concept. We will mainly focus on the problem of characterizing the spin, reduced spin density matrices and spin quantum correlations in inertial reference frames and the apparent paradoxes involved therein. Another important aspect is the use of tools of quantum field theory to extend several concepts in non-relativistic domain to relativistic one. In this regard, we analyze the development of the theory of relativistic secret sharing and a correlation measure namely the entanglement of purification.","{'entanglement of purification': 1, 'quantum information theory': 1}",08.2023,2023,08,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Semisupervised Anomaly Detection using Support Vector Regression with Quantum Kernel,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00583v2,"Kilian Tscharke, Sebastian Issel, Pascal Debus","Anomaly detection (AD) involves identifying observations or events that deviate in some way from the rest of the data. Machine learning techniques have shown success in automating this process by detecting hidden patterns and deviations in large-scale data. The potential of quantum computing for machine learning has been widely recognized, leading to extensive research efforts to develop suitable quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms. In particular, the search for QML algorithms for near-term NISQ devices is in full swing. However, NISQ devices pose additional challenges due to their limited qubit coherence times, low number of qubits, and high error rates. Kernel methods based on quantum kernel estimation have emerged as a promising approach to QML on NISQ devices, offering theoretical guarantees, versatility, and compatibility with NISQ constraints. Especially support vector machines (SVM) utilizing quantum kernel estimation have shown success in various supervised learning tasks. However, in the context of AD, semisupervised learning is of great relevance, and yet there is limited research published in this area. This paper introduces an approach to semisupervised AD based on the reconstruction loss of a support vector regression (SVR) with quantum kernel. This novel model is an alternative to the variational quantum and quantum kernel one-class classifiers, and is compared to a quantum autoencoder as quantum baseline and a SVR with radial-basis-function (RBF) kernel as well as a classical autoencoder as classical baselines. The models are benchmarked extensively on 10 real-world AD data sets and one toy data set, and it is shown that our SVR model with quantum kernel performs better than the SVR with RBF kernel as well as all other models, achieving highest mean AUC over all data sets. In addition, our QSVR outperforms the quantum autoencoder on 9 out of 11 data sets.",{'quantum machine learning': 1},08.2023,2023,08,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']
Loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to quartic order action in ultra slow roll inflation,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.13636v2,"Suvashis Maity, H. V. Ragavendra, Shiv K. Sethi, L. Sriramkumar","[Abridged] In contemporary literature, the calculation of modifications to the inflationary scalar power spectrum due to the loops from the higher order interaction terms in the Hamiltonian have led to a discussion regarding the validity of perturbation theory. Recently, there have been efforts to examine the contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the loops arising from the cubic order terms in the action describing the perturbations, specifically in inflationary scenarios that permit an epoch of ultra slow roll (USR). A phase of USR inflation leads to significant observational consequences, such as the copious production of primordial black holes. In this work, we study the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum in a scenario of USR inflation arising due to the quartic order terms in the action describing the scalar perturbations. We compute the loop contributions to the scalar power spectrum due to the dominant term in the action at the quartic order. We consider a scenario wherein a phase of USR is sandwiched between two stages of slow roll inflation and analyze the behavior of the loop contributions in terms of the parameters involved. We examine the late, intermediate and early epochs of USR during inflation. In the inflationary scenario involving a late phase of USR, for reasonable choices of the parameters, we show that the loop corrections are negligible for the entire range of wave numbers. In the intermediate case, the contributions from the loops prove to be scale invariant over large scales, and we find that these contributions can amount to 30% of the leading order power spectrum. In the case wherein USR sets in early, we find that the loop contributions could be negative and can dominate the power spectrum at the leading order, which indicates a breakdown of the perturbative expansion. We conclude with a brief summary and outlook.",{'black holes': 1},07.2023,2023,07,['Black Holes and GR']

Contrary to the common belief that Hawking radiation is insensitive to UV physics, it turns out that Hawking radiation is subject to significant modifications after the scrambling time.

Maximal Information Leakage from Quantum Encoding of Classical Data,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12529v2,Farhad Farokhi,"A new measure of information leakage for quantum encoding of classical data is defined. An adversary can access a single copy of the state of a quantum system that encodes some classical data and is interested in correctly guessing a general randomized or deterministic function of the data (e.g., a specific feature or attribute of the data in quantum machine learning) that is unknown to the security analyst. The resulting measure of information leakage, referred to as maximal quantum leakage, is the multiplicative increase of the probability of correctly guessing any function of the classical data upon observing measurements of the quantum state. Maximal quantum leakage is shown to satisfy post-processing inequality (i.e., applying a quantum channel reduces information leakage) and independence property (i.e., leakage is zero if the quantum state is independent of the classical data), which are fundamental properties required for privacy and security analysis. It also bounds accessible information.

In this work, we derive a rotating black hole mimicker surrounded by the string cloud (SC), which can be interpolated to represent regular black hole spacetime and traversable wormhole spacetime. We investigate the effect of the spin $a$ and SC parameter $L$ on the observables (shadow radius $R_s$ and distortion $δ_s$) and energy emission rate of the black hole mimicker surrounded by the SC.

In this study, combining the final-state projection model, the non-isometric model of black hole interior and Hayden-Preskill thought experiment, we investigate the information recovery from decoding Hawking radiation and demonstrate the emergence of the Page time in this setup. We incorporate the effective modes into the scrambling inside the horizon, which are usually disregarded in Hayden-Preskill protocols, and show that the Page time can be identified as the transition of information transmission channels from the EPR projection to the local projections. This offers a new perspective on the Page time. We compute the decoupling condition under which retrieving information is feasible and show that this model computes the black hole entropy consistent with the quantum extremal surface calculation.

Though this integral model is not holographic, we do find that it has some holography-like features, especially the near-perfect size winding in high temperatures. Therefore, we would like to call it pseudo-holographic. We also find that the size winding of this model has a narrowly peaked size distribution, which is different from the ordinary SYK model. We apply the traversable wormhole teleportation protocol in the commuting SYK model and find that the teleportation has a few features similar to the semiclassical traversable wormhole but in different parameter regimes. We show that the underlying physics is not entirely determined by the size-winding mechanism but involves the peaked-size mechanism and thermalization.

In this work, we tackle the problem of designing a very shallow quantum circuit, required in the quantum state diagonalization task, by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL). We use a novel encoding method for the RL-state, a dense reward function, and an $ε$-greedy policy to achieve this. We demonstrate that the circuits proposed by the reinforcement learning methods are shallower than the standard variational quantum state diagonalization algorithm and thus can be used in situations where hardware capabilities limit the depth of quantum circuits.

We include partial ionization and partial transparency effects, and the impact of various polarization and steepness of the primary radiation spectrum. The results are obtained with the Monte Carlo code STOKES that considers both line and continuum processes and computes the effects of scattering and absorption inside static homogenous wedge-shaped and elliptical toroidal structures, varying in relative size, composition and distance to the source.

The BHL-BCL crossover: from nonlinear to linear quantum amplification,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.05458v3,"Juan Ramón Muñoz de Nova, Fernando Sols","The black-hole laser (BHL) effect is the self-amplification of Hawking radiation between a pair of horizons which act as a resonant cavity. In a flowing atomic condensate, the BHL effect arises in a finite supersonic region, where Bogoliubov-Cherenkov-Landau (BCL) radiation is resonantly excited by any static perturbation. Thus, experimental attempts to produce a BHL unavoidably deal with the presence of a strong BCL background, making the observation of the BHL effect still a major challenge in the analogue gravity field. Here, we perform a theoretical study of the BHL-BCL crossover using an idealized model where both phenomena can be unambiguously isolated. By drawing an analogy with an unstable pendulum, we distinguish three main regimes according to the interplay between quantum fluctuations and classical stimulation: quantum BHL, classical BHL, and BCL. Based on quite general scaling arguments, the nonlinear amplification of quantum fluctuations up to saturation is identified as the most robust trait of a quantum BHL. A classical BHL behaves instead as a linear quantum amplifier, where the output is proportional to the input. The BCL regime also acts as a linear quantum amplifier, but its gain is exponentially smaller as compared to a classical BHL. Complementary signatures of black-hole lasing are a decrease in the amplification for increasing BCL amplitude or a nonmonotonic dependence of the growth rate with respect to the background parameters. We also identify interesting analogue phenomena such as Hawking-stimulated white-hole radiation or quantum BCL-stimulated Hawking radiation. The results of this work not only are of interest for analogue gravity, where they help to distinguish each phenomenon and to design experimental schemes for a clear observation of the BHL effect, but they also open the prospect of finding applications of analogue concepts in quantum technologies.",{'hawking radiation': 2},06.2023,2023,06,['Black Holes and GR']

This is the case even while the two CFTs describing each asymptotic region are non-interacting. Here, we relate these behind the horizon interactions to non-local quantum computations. This gives a quantum circuit perspective on these interactions, which applies whenever the interaction occurs in the past of a certain extremal surface that sits inside the black hole and in arbitrary dimension. Whenever our perspective applies, we obtain a boundary signature for these interior collisions which is stated in terms of the mutual information. We further revisit the connection discussed earlier between bulk interactions in one sided AdS geometries and non-local computation, and recycle some of our techniques to offer a new perspective on making that connection precise.",{'quantum circuit': 1},04.2023,2023,04,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Schneider","This is the fifth paper in a series of investigations of the clustering properties of luminous, broad-emission-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). In this work we measure the cross-correlation function (CCF) between RASS/SDSS DR14 AGN with the SDSS CMASS galaxy sample at $0.44<z<0.64$. We apply halo occupation distribution (HOD) modeling to the CCF along with the autocorrelation function of the CMASS galaxies. We find that X-ray and optically selected AGN at $0.44<z<0.64$ reside in statistically identical halos with a typical dark matter halo mass of $M_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN} \sim 10^{12.7}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M}_\odot$. The acceptable HOD parameter space for these two broad-line AGN samples have only statistically marginal differences caused by small deviations of the CCFs in the one-halo-dominated regime on small scales. In contrast to optically selected AGN, the X-ray AGN sample may contain a larger population of satellites at $M_{\rm DMH} \sim 10^{13}\,h^{-1}\,\rm{M}_\odot$. We compare our measurements in this work with our earlier studies at lower independent redshift ranges, spanning a look-back time of 6 Gyr. The comparison over this wider redshift range of $0.07<z<0.64$ reveals: (i) no significant difference between the typical DMH masses of X-ray and optically selected AGN, (ii) weak positive clustering dependencies of $M_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN}$ with $L_{\rm X}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$, (iii) no significant dependence of $M_{\rm DMH}^{\rm typ,AGN}$ on Eddington ratio, and (iv) the same DMH masses host more-massive accreting black holes at high redshift than at low redshifts.",{'black holes': 1},04.2023,2023,04,['Black Holes and GR']

This work demonstrates how localization can be observed using a noisy quantum computer by evaluating the magnetization and twist overlap in a quantum spin chain after short-time evolution. The quantities obtained from quantum-circuit simulation and real-device computation show their apparent dependence on disorder strength, although real-device computation suffers from noise-induced errors significantly.

In this paper, we demonstrate that the optimal probabilistic synthesis quadratically reduces the approximation error. Moreover, we show that a deterministic synthesis algorithm can be efficiently converted into a probabilistic one that achieves this quadratic error reduction. We also numerically demonstrate how this conversion reduces the $T$-count and analytically prove that this conversion halves an information-theoretic lower bound on the circuit size.

Disc corona radii and QPO frequencies in black hole binaries: testing Lense-Thirring precession origin,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.08314v4,"Aya Kubota, Chris Done, Kazuki Tsurumi, Ryuki Mizukawa","Stellar-mass black hole binary systems in the luminous X-ray states show a strong quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in their Comptonised emission. The frequency of this feature correlates with the ratio of a disc to Comptonised emission rather than with total luminosity. Hence it changes dramatically during spectral transitions between the hard and soft states. Its amplitude is also strongest in these intermediate states, making them an important test of QPO models. However, these have complex spectra which generally require a disc and two separate Comptonisation components, making it difficult to uniquely derive the spectral parameters. We build a new energy-conserving model of the accretion flow, SSsed model, which assumes a fixed radial emissivity but with a changing emission mechanism. This is similar to the agnsed model in xspec but tuned to be more suitable for stellar mass black holes. It uses a combination of the disc luminosity and temperature to constrain the inner radius of the (colour temperature corrected) blackbody disc, separating this from the more complex Comptonisation spectra emitted inwards of this radius. We show a pilot study of this model fit to hundreds of RXTE spectra of the black hole binary XTE J1550-564. We show that the derived disc radius tightly anti-correlates with the central frequencies of the low-frequency QPO detected in the same observations. The relation is consistent with the quantitative predictions of Lense-Thirring precession of the entire inner Comptonisation regions for the assumed system parameters. This supports the scenario that low-frequency QPOs are caused by Lense-Thirring precession.",{'black holes': 1},02.2023,2023,02,['Black Holes and GR']

The mass functions of PBHs are simply estimated using the conventional Press-Schechter formalism for two paradigms of cosmic origin, including inflationary $Λ$CDM and bounce cosmology. The standard inflationary $Λ$CDM model cannot generate an appreciable number of massive PBHs; however, non-trivial inflation models with blue-tilted power spectra at small scales and matter bounce cosmology provide formation mechanisms for heavy PBHs, which in turn, may seed the observed supermassive black holes (SMBHs). By fitting the SMBH mass functions at high redshift ($z \sim 6$) derived from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS) quasars, for two paradigms of cosmic origin, we derive constraints on the PBH density fraction $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ at $z \sim 6$ and the characteristic mass $M_{\star}$, with the prior assumption that all SMBHs stem from PBHs. We demonstrate that this newly proposed procedure, relying on astronomical measurements that utilize deep-field surveys of SMBHs at high redshift, can be used to constrain models of cosmic origin. Additionally, although not the main focus of this paper, we evolve the mass function from $z\sim6$ to $z\sim0$ through an assumption of $3\times 10^8$-year Eddington's accretion, and give a rough estimation of $f_{\mathrm{PBH}}$ at $z \sim 0$.",{'black holes': 2},01.2023,2023,01,['Black Holes and GR']
Non-local finite-depth circuits for constructing SPT states and quantum cellular automata,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06844v4,"David T. Stephen, Arpit Dua, Ali Lavasani, Rahul Nandkishore","Whether a given target state can be prepared by starting with a simple product state and acting with a finite-depth quantum circuit is a key question in condensed matter physics and quantum information science. It underpins classifications of topological phases, as well as the understanding of topological quantum codes, and has obvious relevance for device implementations. Traditionally, this question assumes that the quantum circuit is made up of unitary gates that are geometrically local. Inspired by the advent of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, we reconsider this question with $k$-local gates, i.e. gates that act on no more than $k$ degrees of freedom, but are not restricted to be geometrically local. First, we construct explicit finite-depth circuits of symmetric $k$-local gates which create symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states from an initial a product state. Our construction applies both to SPT states protected by global symmetries and subsystem symmetries, but not to those with higher-form symmetries, which we conjecture remain nontrivial. Next, we show how to implement arbitrary translationally invariant quantum cellular automata (QCA) in any dimension using finite-depth circuits of $k$-local gates. These results imply that the topological classifications of SPT phases and QCA both collapse to a single trivial phase in the presence of $k$-local interactions. We furthermore argue that SPT phases are fragile to generic $k$-local symmetric perturbations. We conclude by discussing the implications for other phases, such as fracton phases, and surveying future directions. Our analysis opens a new experimentally motivated conceptual direction examining the stability of phases and the feasibility of state preparation without the assumption of geometric locality.",{'quantum circuit': 2},12.2022,2022,12,['Quantum Computers and Quantum Information']

Black holes shielded by magnetic fields,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11356v3,Chandrachur Chakraborty,"Black holes (BHs) formed by collapsing and/or merging of magnetized progenitors, have magnetic fields penetrating the event horizon, and there are several possible scenarios. Thus, the no-hair theorem that assumes the outside medium is a vacuum, is not applicable in this case. Bearing this in mind and considering a Schwarzschild BH of mass $M$ immersed in a uniform magnetic field $B$, we show that all three frequencies related to the equatorial circular orbit of a test particle become imaginary for the orbits of radii $r_B > 2B^{-1}$. It signifies that if a BH is surrounded by a magnetic field of order $B \sim R_g^{-1}$ (where $R_g$ is the gravitational radius of the BH), a test particle could unable to continue its regular geodesic motion from/at $r > r_B$, hence the accretion disk could not be formed, and the motion of other stellar objects around the BH could be absent. As the BHs are generally detected by watching for their effects on nearby stars and gas, a magnetic field of order $B \sim R_g^{-1}$ could be able to shield a BH in such a way that it could remain undetectable. Motivated with this theoretical investigation and considering the sphere (of radius $r_f$) of magnetic influence around an astrophysical BH, we constrain $B$, above which a magnetized BH could remain undetectable. For example, $M=10^9M_{\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^6$ G and $M=10M_{\odot}$ BH surrounded by $B > 10^{14}$ G could remain undetectable for $r_f \sim 10^5R_g$.

In nonequilibrium scenarios, these manifest in phenomena such as many-body insulating states and anomalous scaling laws of currents of conserved quantities, crucial for applications in quantum circuit technologies. In this work we propose a giant rectification scheme based on the asymmetric interplay between strong particle interactions and a tilted potential, each of which induces an insulating state on their own. While for reverse bias both cooperate and induce a strengthened insulator with an exponentially suppressed current, for forward bias they compete generating conduction resonances; this leads to a rectification coefficient of many orders of magnitude. We uncover the mechanism underlying these resonances as enhanced coherences between energy eigenstates occurring at avoided crossings in the system's bulk energy spectrum. Furthermore, we demonstrate the complexity of the many-body nonequilibrium conducting state through the emergence of enhanced density matrix impurity and operator space entanglement entropy close to the resonances.

Dark Black Holes in the Mass Gap,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08557v2,"Nicolas Fernandez, Akshay Ghalsasi, Stefano Profumo, Nolan Smyth, Lillian Santos-Olmsted","In the standard picture of stellar evolution, pair-instability -- the energy loss in stellar cores due to electron-positron pair production -- is predicted to prevent the collapse of massive stars into black holes with mass in the range between approximately 50 and 130 solar masses -- a range known as the ""{\em black hole mass gap}"". LIGO detection of black hole binary mergers containing one or both black holes with masses in this {\em mass gap} thus challenges the standard picture, possibly pointing to an unexpected merger history, unanticipated or poorly understood astrophysical mechanisms, or new physics. Here, we entertain the possibility that a ""dark sector"" exists, consisting of dark electrons, dark protons, and electromagnetic-like interactions, but no nuclear forces. Dark stars would inevitably form given such dark sector constituents, possibly collapsing into black holes with masses within the mass gap. We study in detail the cooling processes necessary for successful stellar collapse in the dark sector and show that for suitable choices of the particle masses, we indeed predict populating the mass gap with dark sector black holes. In particular, we numerically find that the heavier of the two dark sector massive particles cannot be lighter than, approximately, the visible sector proton for the resulting dark sector black holes to have masses within the mass gap.

The training of such models corresponds to solving a convex optimization problem either via its primal or dual formulation. Due to the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the training algorithms are affected by statistical uncertainty, which has a major impact on their complexity. We show that the dual problem can be solved in $O(M^{4.67}/\varepsilon^2)$ quantum circuit evaluations, where $M$ denotes the size of the data set and $\varepsilon$ the solution accuracy compared to the ideal result from exact expectation values, which is only obtainable in theory.

Dequantizing the Quantum Singular Value Transformation: Hardness and Applications to Quantum Chemistry and the Quantum PCP Conjecture,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.09079v5,"Sevag Gharibian, François Le Gall","The Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) is a recent technique that gives a unified framework to describe most quantum algorithms discovered so far, and may lead to the development of novel quantum algorithms. In this paper we investigate the hardness of classically simulating the QSVT. A recent result by Chia, Gilyén, Li, Lin, Tang and Wang (STOC 2020) showed that the QSVT can be efficiently ""dequantized"" for low-rank matrices, and discussed its implication to quantum machine learning. In this work, motivated by establishing the superiority of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry and making progress on the quantum PCP conjecture, we focus on the other main class of matrices considered in applications of the QSVT, sparse matrices.
  We first show how to efficiently ""dequantize"", with arbitrarily small constant precision, the QSVT associated with a low-degree polynomial. We apply this technique to design classical algorithms that estimate, with constant precision, the singular values of a sparse matrix. We show in particular that a central computational problem considered by quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry (estimating the ground state energy of a local Hamiltonian when given, as an additional input, a state sufficiently close to the ground state) can be solved efficiently with constant precision on a classical computer. As a complementary result, we prove that with inverse-polynomial precision, the same problem becomes BQP-complete. This gives theoretical evidence for the superiority of quantum algorithms for chemistry, and strongly suggests that said superiority stems from the improved precision achievable in the quantum setting.

One of the main open problems is the lack of ergodicity, or mode collapse, for typical stochastic solvers based on Monte Carlo techniques leading to poor generalization or lack of robustness to uncertainties. Currently, there is no universal metric to quantify such performance deficiencies across various solvers. Here, we introduce a new diversity measure for quantifying the number of independent approximate solutions for NP-hard optimization problems. Among others, it allows benchmarking solver performance by a required time-to-diversity (TTD), a generalization of often used time-to-solution (TTS). We illustrate this metric by comparing the sampling power of various quantum annealing strategies. In particular, we show that the inhomogeneous quantum annealing schedules can redistribute and suppress the emergence of topological defects by controlling space-time separated critical fronts, leading to an advantage over standard quantum annealing schedules with respect to both TTS and TTD for finding rare solutions. Using path-integral Monte Carlo simulations for up to 1600 qubits, we demonstrate that nonequilibrium driving of quantum fluctuations, guided by efficient approximate tensor network contractions, can significantly reduce the fraction of hard instances for random frustrated 2D spin-glasses with local fields. Specifically, we observe that by creating a class of algorithmic quantum phase transitions, the diversity of solutions can be enhanced by up to 40% with the fraction of hard-to-sample instances reducing by more than 25%.",{'tensor network': 1},10.2021,2021,10,['Tensor Networks']

A parallel quantum algorithm is proposed for simulating the dynamics of a large class of Hamiltonians with good sparse structures, called uniform-structured Hamiltonians, including various Hamiltonians of practical interest like local Hamiltonians and Pauli sums. Given the oracle access to the target sparse Hamiltonian, in both query and gate complexity, the running time of our parallel quantum simulation algorithm measured by the quantum circuit depth has a doubly (poly-)logarithmic dependence $\operatorname{polylog}\log(1/ε)$ on the simulation precision $ε$. This presents an exponential improvement over the dependence $\operatorname{polylog}(1/ε)$ of previous optimal sparse Hamiltonian simulation algorithm without parallelism. To obtain this result, we introduce a novel notion of parallel quantum walk, based on Childs' quantum walk. The target evolution unitary is approximated by a truncated Taylor series, which is obtained by combining these quantum walks in a parallel way. A lower bound $Ω(\log \log (1/ε))$ is established, showing that the $ε$-dependence of the gate depth achieved in this work cannot be significantly improved.
  Our algorithm is applied to simulating three physical models: the Heisenberg model, the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and a quantum chemistry model in second quantization.
